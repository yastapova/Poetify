You throw away everything that she made
you never did this before
how could you make someone lay where she laid ? 
she gave you her all , why didn 't you just love her more ? 
she thought what you guys had was sweet
but you had to walk out and left her incomplete .
I saw a girl the other day ; 
she looked very sad . 
Her face was drawn and pale , 
her eyes were red and puffy from many tears . 
There were still tears in her eyes yet unshed 
as I stared . 
Her cheeks were hollow and colorless , 
she was nothing special to look at . 
In her eyes was the look of loneliness , the absence of passion . 
At the instant I saw it , the sadness was gone ; 
in its place : cold acceptance . 
I wanted to tell her the sorrow wouldn 't last , 
but when I stretched out my hand , only my reflection reached back .
Take this kiss upon the brow !
and , in parting from you now 
thus much let me avow-
you are not wrong , who deem
that my days have been a dream
yet if hop has flown away 
in a night or in a day 
in a vision or in none
is it therefore the less
gone all that we see to 
seem is but a dream within a
dream I stand amid the roar 
of a surf- tormented shore
and I hold within my hand
grains of golden sand how
few ! yet how they creep
though my fingers to 
deep while I weep -while 
I weep o god ! can I not save
one from the pitiless wave ?
is all that we see or seem 
but a dream within a dream ?
I 'm tired of waiting
waiting for you to call
waiting for you to do
anything at all .
You 're terribly tempting ,
yet here I am waiting , and always thinking of you .
I want you to stay ,
and stand here by me tall ...
but that 's not what happens ,
no baby nothing at all .
You walk by and smile I cherish the view ,
There 's nothing to do , but sit around waiting for you .
I 'm 
I 'm tired of waiting ,
my body is aching .
I 'm starting to lose hope , I 'm giving up within .
If you want me at all , you 'd better act fast ,
or I 'm moving on and forgetting the past .
Not like anything happened ,
It was nothing but dreams ,
But Please try and hurry , before I slip downstream .
Hasten the pace , you 're long overdue
but I like you that much , I 'll wait forever for you .
People sacrifice their lives everyday
so our countries freedom will stay .
They work so hard to reach that goal
some will die and leave their families with an empty soul .
Hearing the sound of children crying .
Nurses running around trying to save lives
war is like sharp knives .
It 's so hard not to think about how they must feel .
All of those innocent people that the enemies kill .
They have helped us be where we are today
and hopefully it will stay that way .
Peering through the window , water apple leaves
sway with the breeze ; dancers of the night
with green veined fingers cast quirky shadows
against the cream-colored concrete walls .
Beneath them , I turn to the porcelain cup 
in my hands , whirling the tinted water of 
fresh picked tea leaves invisible under steam
before lushing up to quench my thirst .
I look up and marvel 
as succulent water apples 
bounce back and forth
from their wellspring
like little children 
playing tug-of-war .
It 's an ingenuous spectacle 
of swollen receptacles and 
calluses on chlorophyll clothes
and cellulose accessories .
With the wind swatting their soft skins , 
I wonder how they held on
and remained firm with every blow .
Wouldn 't they want to be free 
and relish liberty on the ground ? 
I lay my back on a soft cushion 
as the reality finally convinces me 
life --
in its bare simplicity .
I simply smile .
Fresh sunbeams scald my face , 
as I trot the shore 
of a long forgotten past .
Waves shiver and hiss toward me
like it always had ... years ago ,
when he was still here
beside me , hand in hand .
On this island ,
memories were carved not 
on mortal minds but on the sea
who was a witness to it all .
From love 's delight 
to broken promises ,
fate took its plight
at every turn .
Swan-necked waves 
used to spring up so high
and slither back to its hub
when we first exchanged 
our vows of love .
I remember the sunshine 
playing with our toes
when we kicked sand and stones
to form castles in the wind .
Like little children
we were so free
on our little heaven
we thought would be forever .
I turn and watch once more
as the tide ebbs slowly
leaving the rocky sand 
dry and sparkling under my feet .
It 's summer once again
and thoughts of him
shatter in my head
like the ebbing waves .
It was on this island
where our love started to bloom ;
but like flowers that bloom and die
so did our love ...
what it would be ,
if I never found you .
what will it be
if you had not found me .
will it be the same ,
I wonder ,
an ain 't answer ,
could the dime ,
give the thyme .
you came like an angel ,
and brighten the days ,
you gone like the wind ,
when my heart had fill with grace .
will you come back again ,
thats all I could wish ,
will the wish be in my dreams ,
I wonder ?
I wish you had not gone ,
but I could fill your soul had not gone .
I know I 'm the reason for all your problems
I know I 'm the one who caused them
I know I 'm the one that doesn 't do things right
I know I don 't always get my way
I know I deserve all those mean things you say
I know I 'm the one always ruining your day
But baby listen to what I gotta say
I 'm sorry for all the shit I 've done
Yea baby I know it was dumb but all I wanted to do was have fun
I know you get mad when you find out what I did
I know you think I 'm acting like a little kid
I know I 'm the reason we fell apart
I know I 'm the reason for your broken heart
I know that these are your worse fears
And I know I 'm not the one suppose to be shedding these tears
I know I 'm cause for your pain and hurt
I know I 'm the reason you always feel like dirt
I know if I would have tired we would have made it
But if I knew this would happen I would have stayed with it
You think I don 't care but I do cause to find a good man like is rare
I know you don 't know what to do with me
But be patience listen ,and wait and see
I don 't know about some things you do
But I do know that I love you
The way that you left me hurt me more than anything
I don 't understand how our love fell apart
You knew how to get to me and what hurt my heart
You took advantage of my emotional ways and ripped me apart
I still think of you although I try to keep you off my mind
I will never forget you I thought you were one of a kind
All boys are the same because they all want one thing
It makes me mad that I let myself end up like this
Knowing good and well that it was all too good to be true
I still hoped for more than this
I don 't see how this ended like this and in this way
It hurts my heart and makes me cry
I cry
And cry
And cry , and then I think of how mean you were to me
You would lie and cheat and tell me you loved me
But were they all lies ? Was it just a joke ?
I will never know
All I know is that I have done the right thing
I said goodbye to you and your conceded ways
All you thought about was yourself
And the result of that ends good for you
Because now your just like you were before a young dumb girl fell for 
you
Alone
Like you will be until you find someone else
That 's stupid like I was
And thinks that you love her
When really all you want is to break her heart
Shit gets said and let go
Because I didn 't want you to be mad at me
But in the end I see…it was never me
It was you
You were the one that lost in the end
You lost in your own little pitiful game
And now I sit and smile
Laugh
And think about you
Being such a jerk
And how I deserve so much better
Now I want to thank you
You helped me realize how much better I can do
So thanks
And 
 ... you 
Sitting here , thinking of you ,
About how you do the things that you do .
Knowing that we were supposed to be ,
But when I look in your eyes , It 's not me that you see .
The thoughts that keep showing , up in my head ,
Are making me run ,crying ,back to my bed .
The visions of you , that I can still see ,
Can 't stop the hurt from swelling inside of me .
Thinking of times when you made me laugh ,
The memories of you , come rushing back .
Now I go back , and I reminisce , 
I guess I 'm still waiting for true loves first kiss ... ... 
A lifetime filled with cheating hearts , 
all echo from my past , 
The " promise trues " and " I love you 's , " 
each one was meant to last . 
So fine this line of sharing , 
built with honesty and trust , 
Each vow now left inside my head , 
to slowly gather dust . 
I struggle to tomorrow , searching hope , 
yet walking blind , 
While broken dreams , and silent screams , 
play re-runs in my mind . 
I try to shake , each past mistake , 
and meet what lies ahead , 
While hearing cold reminders 
of these promises once said . 
It 's hard to feel , what 's wrong from real , 
when shadows dim the light , 
I close my eyes and dream a dream 
of heaven every night . 
Is all I know , this history I hold 
a guiding hand ? 
These scars I show , 
a lesson that I yet don 't understand ? 
Another day away Love Without Good-byes
There 's a coast , a westward shore , a beach where in my mind
The sunset , ebb and tide , and every wave to its zenith climbs
Where swells and crests collide to redefine serenity 's design
And oceans of hope form by a love seeming altogether right
The windows of beachfront homes do not present time ordinarily
Each crash and pulsing of the sea breaks boredom 's monotony
And the spray salting the air becomes spice to both top and lower lip
Making each kiss long , lasting , and lucid over the whole of days lived
The picket fence won 't stand against the wind 's fierce persistence
Paint and style weather 's wear will strip from a home 's elegant finish
And glass panes will be scratched and scraped by sand blown days
Till its foundation some morning cedes to erosion and coastal rains
But I will always feel the same about you when the tides roll in
When my dreams be swept away , will I be washed away with you ?
You look into my eyes and see I 'm in pain
It 's as if you have nothing to lose nothing to gain
I am no one special but your still here
And for some reason you 're my number one fear
Trusting you takes a lot from me
But trust is the most important key
I feel like I need you to live
But I have nothing to offer you or give
I 'm not worth it I 'm no one at all
you might as well just watch me as I fall
My world will be smashed
My dreams are already crashed
You shouldn 't waste your time with me like this
I 'm no one that you 're going to miss
I 'm filled with pain and filled with sorrow
I don 't know why I bother living for tomorrow
Empty is all that I am and all I will ever be
It really isn 't that hard to see
I 'm dead on the inside and I cry
It 's caused from lie after lie
Your trying to save me but there 's no use
My emotions are all over it feels like abuse
As I sit here wanting to die
You stand there not willing to say goodbye
Why am I standing at your door ?
Looking up at the sky that heavily pours ,
Watching the rain fall to the grass ,
Looking at the cars slowly pass ,
Pounding at the door do loud ,
Screaming , crying and yelling loud ,
Seeing the shadows creep ,
Under the door with out a peep ,
So why do you feel so happy like about this ,
Breaking my heart as it is ,
Keep thinking about you
How you used to do those things you do ,
The sky used to be blue with a touch of grey ,
Now it is black all around all day ,
The walls are closing on me ,
There 's pain in my heart can 't you see ,
Why am I left out in the cold ?
With out your warm body to hold ,
Now seeing your perfect face ,
Is a hard big disgrace ,
So why do you feel so happy like about this ,
Breaking my heart as it is ,
Keep thinking about you
How you used to do those things you do ,
The sky used to be blue with a touch of grey ,
Now it is black all around all day ,
The walls are closing on me ,
There 's pain in my heart can 't you see ,
The sky used to be blue with a touch of grey ,
So why do you feel so happy like about this ,
Breaking my heart as it is ,
Keep thinking about you
How you used to do those things you do ,
The sky used to be blue with a touch of grey ,
Now it is black all around all day ,
The walls are closing on me ,
There 's pain in my heart can 't you see ,
The walls are closing in on me ,
There is pain inside you can 't see ,
Can 't you see ?
Can 't you see ?
When I wake up in the morning
Your the one who 's on my mind
When we 're not together
I feel I 'm left behind
You 're the one I truly love
And who makes me feel so good
The one I can 't stop thinking of
And the one I never would
I see no one else but you
It 's almost like I 'm blind
You 're the one I love the most
And you 're always on my mind
I am lonely
in the dark room
because it breaks my heart .
I sit on the chair
and I look in the mirror .
It comes to my mind
so I start feeling .
I close my eyes
and shake my head
and think of myself .
(Thinks)(Signs)(Whispers)
It speaks from my voice .
I opened my eyes
and look straight in the mirror .
In my mind , 
I don 't know if I have a future in this real world , just to survive .
I look around 
and stand up and walk around
in the dark room .
I couldn 't breathe into the air .
I ought to get out of here
in the dark room .
I open the door
and look up at the bright stars .
In the past my love never last
Now I have a love for me that
is so strong and willing to take 
a chance
again together are love spreads
we have effected everyone around us
are love means the world to us
the tenderness ,the gentleness
and quite romantic us
that describes us very well
sweet and innocent
pretty much says it all
but then again not everyone
is as innocent after all
are joy of happiness effects
everyone now they can have some fun
baby are love will never end
we will be together forever
You and I equal one .
When you Kiss me , we become one .
When you hold me , we become one .
When you are making love you me , we become one .
When you say " I love you " , we become one .
When you know I 'm your future , we become one .
When all is said and done , we end each night with a kiss and tight 
embrace as you hold me in your arms all night as if we our one .
Life goes on ,
its like a song ,
it never stop playing until its gone ,
Life goes on ,
never give up just be strong ,
no matter who says what just hold on ,
Life goes on ,
love your life no matter what goes wrong ,
your family still loves you no matter how much you 've grown ,
Life goes on just keep on playing that song !
I will love you today
I will love you tomorrow
Please don 't break my heart if I give it to
you to borrow
I have had a rough life as you already know
Until I met you it was filled with sorrow
But if we work together you see
We can open the doors to lot 's of possibilities
Together as one is what it will have to be 
Cause you without me I just don 't see 
the land of my people
crying and crying
seeing no help coming 
to see the gongly voices 
all from hills and valleys
crowning from the innocent belly
with many black faces dancing acrobatics
oh my people ... my people
lets pay royalty to our ancestors
now and now till the voice come 
My mind is in a haze ,my thoughts are a maze .
My destiny is unknown , not knowing what is to be .
What 's going to set me free .
That puts fear deep within side of me .
Darkness wants to fall upon my soul .
Do to me as it wills ,no concern on how it feels .
Falling further into this maze of haze .
My life before me seems like nothing but a daze .
Is this something a must go threw ,Only if I knew .
Must I bare this darkness within me .
So I can be risen from the shadows and become a new .
To feel joy ,life , and laughter ,thats what my soul is after .
If this is my destiny , I 'm ready to stand and fight .
So I can once again live in the light .
Darkness and despair will be on guard .
This emotional battle will be hard . 
I enter this battle with a strong sense of love .
Giving to me from straight above .
I thought I 'd found love
when I met you .
But with time
I am changing my opinion .
Each new day reaffirms
my changing perception .
Each consecutive time I meet you
confirms ,
transforms the perception into a fact .
The fact that I love you so much more today ,
that what I thought was love on day one ,
was sheer mockery .
I love you so much
more everyday
Yesterday , I loved you much more
than a few days before yesterday .
Today my cup is full to the brim .
I am looking forward to tomorrow
and all our tomorrows together .
Only if you knew
How much I loved you 
When you left 
that is when I actually found out how much I loved you .
I would do anything to still be with you
I wanted to be with you forever and just to be there to be by your 
side .
I was happy but now I 'm not because I lost the one I loved so much .
If I had to choose right now who I wanted to spend the rest of my life 
with I would choose you . You are the one I loved so much . I didn 't 
know I could love a boy so much until you left 
Do you believe on magic ?
that has many logics ,
and more on dramatics ,
which is full of fantasies .
The magic ,
among billions of people around ,
God let us meet on the grounds ,
and its you I have found ,
like music that has rhythm of sounds .
The magic ,
I have felt the first time I saw you ,
my heart and mind screaming for you ,
and my hearts beat I love you ,
you and me will be forever do .
The magic ,
we felt same feelings and true love ,
and I 'm so thankful to God above ,
that we had this special true love ,
this is really magic we 've got .
Loving one another ,
doing things that we love together ,
knowing you more better ,
I 'm looking forward to be with each other .
When we are together ,
we will have a lots of laughter ,
exploring this mystery world deeper ,
struggling magical things higher .
No one can make us apart , never !
even hindrances wont get us bother ,
we will fight our love on very eager ,
you and I will be great fighter .
My love for you grows more stronger ,
holding each others hand as lover ,
our love will keep us greater ,
and , I will always love you forever .
Sometimes I feel to give up ,
this life 's that so tough ,
but , seems like I have courage through miles ,
when I see your smile .
You came into my life ,
sorrows I had was like cut by a knife ,
this is such wonderful feeling I had ,
its just like you sent from up above .
Since the day I have you ,
we 've been together so true ,
one day , I told you that , I love you ,
means , forever in my heart , I really do .
When I see you smiling ,
oh , you make my heart sing ,
when I hear you laughing ,
you are really my everything .
Believe in your heart ,
Something will happen in your life ,
Believe in your hard work ,
Something will happen in your life ,
Believe in your success ,
Something will happen in your life ,
Believe in your own power ,
Something will happen in your life ,
Believe in your true love ,
Something will happen in your life ,
Believe in your sacrifice ,
Something will happen in your life ,
Believe in your death ,
Something will happen in your life ,
Always believe in Miracles ,
Have you ever cried because someone you love
told you a lie ? The kind of lie you don 't need to deny ? That makes you 
feel like you just want to die ?
All because you know its just another one of there lies ?
Then why do you continue to tell me lies ? Do you want 
to make me cry , or have my thoughts of you forever known as a big lie ?
I 'm not here to listen to your lies ! I 'm here because your the best 
thing thats happened in my life ! So now I 'm letting you know you don 't have 
to lie , because I 'll love you forever even if your not by my side ! ! 
I love you and I know I do , but then I
think put yourself in his shoes . He got
a lot going on in his life , like the
depression from loosing his wife . Maybe
I 'm putting too much on his shoulders ,
maybe I 'm in his way like a big boulder .
Maybe I 'm the one stressing him , maybe I
should leave him alone until he 's ready ,
instead of breathing down his neck
steadily . Jamie I know you love me , but
sometimes even though it may be the best
it is hard to set the one you love free .
but I want you to love me , be with me , or
maybe just hold me , that is a way to tell
you really love me . when you don 't talk to
me I feel like I could die ,and deep down
inside sometimes I could cry . When you
talk to me I get happy , and no longer feel
so crappy . I love you and that 's all that
matters .
It 's the silence of your Kiss ,
It 's the warmth I feel in your touch ,
It 's the I love you I hear every morning ,
That makes Us mean so much .
It 's the summer breeze ,
Upon your face ,
To the perfect summer together , 
Filled with love and grace .
It 's as joyful as your first step ,
Your first glimpse of snow ,
and the feeling you get ,
Just before you have accomplished something .
what is " It " You ask ?
It is Love ,
and that of the wind ,
you can 't see it ,
but you can feel it ,
and the feeling felt once ,
Can Last a lifetime .
The tears fell like rain from my eyes , felt as if they would never 
end ,
The pain from deep within my heart , feeling as if in two it would be 
rend .
Feeling totally lost and alone , despair soon has become my cruel 
reality ,
Life unending must go on for some , while for others death is their 
finality .
One day at a time we must be strong , trying to rebuild our lives and 
move on ,
The intense burning pain of our heart , as life goes on will someday be 
foregone .
But the memories we carry until our own time comes , will always 
patiently be there ,
We will relive the relationships of our past , and cherish the moments 
we shared .
After our time has come , and our journey through this world has ceased ,
Our friends and loved ones , will miss us once we have become deceased .
Then our fond memories they will carry , while traveling on through 
time ,
Thinking of our special moments we shared , will leave them feeling 
sublime .
Dearest reader there were trees 
formed of wire , broad entryways 
beneath balconies beneath spires 
youthful head come to rest in meadow 
beside bend in gravel road , still 
body of milky liquid
her hair alight and so on 
successive halls , flowered carpets and doors 
or the photograph of nothing but pigeons 
and grackles by the shadow of a fountain .
So that each
is its own , now--each has fallen , blond stillness .
Closer , above them ,
the damselflies pass as they would over water , 
if the fruit were water ,
or as bees would , if they weren 't
somewhere else , had the fruit found
already a point more steep
in rot , as soon it must , if
none shall lift it from the grass whose damp only 
softens further those parts where flesh
goes soft .
There are those
whom no amount of patience looks likely
to improve ever , I always said , meaning
gift is random , 
assigned here , 
here withheld--almost always
correctly
as it 's turned out : how your hands clear
easily the wreckage ;
how you stand--like a building for a time condemned ,
then deemed historic . Yes . You
will be saved .
Black lake , black boat , two black , cut-paper people .
Where do the black trees go that drink here ?
Their shadows must cover Canada .
A little light is filtering from the water flowers .
Their leaves do not wish us to hurry :
They are round and flat and full of dark advice .
Cold worlds shake from the oar .
The spirit of blackness is in us , it is in the fishes .
A snag is lifting a valedictory , pale hand ;
Stars open among the lilies .
Are you not blinded by such expressionless sirens ?
This is the silence of astounded souls .
Living in the earth-deposits of our history
Today a backhoe divulged out of a crumbling flank of earth
one bottle amber perfect a hundred-year-old
cure for fever or melancholy a tonic
for living on this earth in the winters of this climate .
Today I was reading about Marie Curie :
she must have known she suffered from radiation sickness
her body bombarded for years by the element
she had purified
It seems she denied to the end
the source of the cataracts on her eyes
the cracked and suppurating skin of her finger-ends
till she could no longer hold a test-tube or a pencil
She died a famous woman denying
her wounds
denying
her wounds came from the same source as her power . 
Nothing would sleep in that cellar , dank as a ditch ,
Bulbs broke out of boxes hunting for chinks in the dark ,
Shoots dangled and drooped ,
Lolling obscenely from mildewed crates ,
Hung down long yellow evil necks , like tropical snakes .
And what a congress of stinks !
Roots ripe as old bait ,
Pulpy stems , rank , silo-rich ,
Leaf-mold , manure , lime , piled against slippery planks .
Nothing would give up life :
Even the dirt kept breathing a small breath .
Here ,
in the room of my life
the objects keep changing .
Ashtrays to cry into ,
the suffering brother of the wood walls ,
the forty-eight keys of the typewriter
each an eyeball that is never shut ,
the books , each a contestant in a beauty contest ,   
the black chair , a dog coffin made of Naugahyde ,   
the sockets on the wall
waiting like a cave of bees ,
the gold rug
a conversation of heels and toes ,
the fireplace
a knife waiting for someone to pick it up ,
the sofa , exhausted with the exertion of a whore ,   
the phone
two flowers taking root in its crotch ,
the doors
opening and closing like sea clams ,
the lights
poking at me ,
lighting up both the soil and the laugh .
The windows ,
the starving windows
that drive the trees like nails into my heart .   
Each day I feed the world out there
although birds explode
right and left .
I feed the world in here too ,
offering the desk puppy biscuits .
However , nothing is just what it seems to be .   
My objects dream and wear new costumes ,
compelled to , it seems , by all the words in my hands   
and the sea that bangs in my throat .
I have gone out , a possessed witch ,   
haunting the black air , braver at night ;   
dreaming evil , I have done my hitch   
over the plain houses , light by light :   
lonely thing , twelve-fingered , out of mind .   
A woman like that is not a woman , quite .   
I have been her kind .
I have found the warm caves in the woods ,   
filled them with skillets , carvings , shelves ,   
closets , silks , innumerable goods ;
fixed the suppers for the worms and the elves :   
whining , rearranging the disaligned .
A woman like that is misunderstood .
I have been her kind .
I have ridden in your cart , driver ,
waved my nude arms at villages going by ,   
learning the last bright routes , survivor   
where your flames still bite my thigh
and my ribs crack where your wheels wind .   
A woman like that is not ashamed to die .   
I have been her kind .
This strange thing must have crept   
Right out of hell .
It resembles a bird 's foot
Worn around the cannibal 's neck .
As you hold it in your hand ,
As you stab with it into a piece of meat ,
It is possible to imagine the rest of the bird :   
Its head which like your fist
Is large , bald , beakless , and blind .
We were never formally introduced .
I had no idea who among them was really I ?
It was like a discreet entourage .
Each one about the same height .
Variously dressed we took the subway
Stealing peeks at each other over newspapers .
In moments of danger , they made themselves
scarce .
Where did they all disappear ?
I asked some mugger one night
While he held a knife to my throat ,
But he was spooked too ,
Letting me go without a word ,
Skipping over rain puddles
As if chased by his own shadow .
It was disconcerting , not to say criminal .
Flustered as I was , I reached
For the little black comb
I keep tucked in my breast pocket ,
To run it through my hair once ,
And make absolutely certain
At least one of us was still here .
A light is on in my father 's study .
" Still up ? " he says , and we are silent ,
looking at the harbor lights ,
listening to the surf
and the creak of coconut boughs .
He is working late on cases .
No impassioned speech ! He argues from evidence ,
actually pacing out and measuring ,
while the fans revolving on the ceiling
winnow the true from the false .
Once he passed a brass curtain rod
through a head made out of plaster
and showed the jury the angle of fire--
where the murderer must have stood .
For years , all through my childhood ,
if I opened a closet ... bang !
There would be the dead man 's head
with a black hole in the forehead .
All the arguing in the world
will not stay the moon .
She has come all the way from Russia
to gaze for a while in a mango tree
and light the wall of a veranda ,
before resuming her interrupted journey
beyond the harbor and the lighthouse
at Port Royal , turning away
from land to the open sea .
Yet , nothing in nature changes , from that day to this ,
she is still the mother of us all .
I can see the drifting offshore lights ,
black posts where the pelicans brood .
And the light that used to shine
at night in my father 's study
now shines as late in mine .
In her hand the knife , brisk , brilliant as moon-claw ,
shaves the flesh . It grazes the white
belly just over the heart .
Underneath , the coiled fingers
are cradling a soft flesh
as if it were the jowls of the aged
man propped for a while on the bench in the park .
The head is not severed , the eyes not out .
Blue , they appear to flash odd ways
where a tree makes a live shadow .
Mostly the eyes are dead .
Nothing is in them
except the intense blue of sky the tree allows .
There is no conspiring of nerves ,
no least event recalled
by a limb 's high arching ,
or even a girl 's ascension
from a forgotten distance of water .
But there is something as she lifts the meat .
It is enough to draw down her gaze .
Now her arm rises against
yellow hair fallen
white in a childish face .
She is still as a leaf barely clinging .
I come to her like a cat in the stunned grass
and touch her to see the startled ,
upthrusted gleam of her face .
At brow and each cheek
like gathered beads of mist
scales leap with the sun , and are dead .
No word passes between us , but something electric
as a flash of steel makes her
cry out just once . Squatting
at the yard 's edge , she
sings beyond any thought .
Her knife flies as lethal as love
and cuts quickly in like a hurried kiss .
I   
 " One Snodgrass , two Snodgrass , three Snodgrass , four ...
       I took my own rollcall when I counted seconds ;   
 " One two three , Two two three , Three ... , " the drum score   
       Showed only long rests to the tympani 's entrance .   
 " Oh-oh-oh leff ; leff ; leff-toh-righ-toh-leff , "   
       The sergeant cadenced us footsore recruits ;   
The heart , poor drummer , gone lame , deaf ,   
       Then AWOL , gets frogmarched to the noose .

Old coots , at the Veterans ', might catch breath   
       If their cheeks got slapped by a nurse 's aide ,   
Then come back to life ; just so , at their birth ,   
       Young rumps had been tendered warm accolades .   
The kick-ass rude attitude , smart-assed insult ,   
       The acid-fueled book review just might shock   
Us back to the brawl like smelling salts ,   
       Might sting the lulled heart up off its blocks .

I thought I 'd always favor rubato   
       Or syncopation , scorning fixed rhythms ;   
               Thought my old heartthrobs could stand up to stress ;   
Believed one 's bloodpump should skip a few beats   
       If it fell into company with sleek young women ;   
               Believed my own bruit could beat with the best .   
Wrong again , Snodgrass ! This new gold gadget ,   
       Snug as the watch on my wife 's warm wrist ,   
               Drives my pulsetempo near twice its old pace —   
Go , nonstop startwatch ! Go , clockwork rabbit ,   
       Keeping this lame old dog synchronized ,   
               Steady , sparked up , still in the race .
He had driven half the night
From far down San Joaquin
Through Mariposa , up the
Dangerous Mountain roads ,
And pulled in at eight a .m .
With his big truckload of hay
            behind the barn .
With winch and ropes and hooks
We stacked the bales up clean
To splintery redwood rafters
High in the dark , flecks of alfalfa
Whirling through shingle-cracks of light ,
Itch of haydust in the 
            sweaty shirt and shoes .
At lunchtime under Black oak
Out in the hot corral ,
---The old mare nosing lunchpails ,
Grasshoppers crackling in the weeds---
" I 'm sixty-eight " he said ,
" I first bucked hay when I was seventeen .
I thought , that day I started ,
I sure would hate to do this all my life .
And dammit , that 's just what
I 've gone and done . "
The first time I walked 
With a girl , I was twelve , 
Cold , and weighted down 
With two oranges in my jacket . 
December .  Frost cracking 
Beneath my steps , my breath 
Before me , then gone , 
As I walked toward 
Her house , the one whose 
Porch light burned yellow 
Night and day , in any weather . 
A dog barked at me , until 
She came out pulling 
At her gloves , face bright 
With rouge .  I smiled , 
Touched her shoulder , and led 
Her down the street , across 
A used car lot and a line 
Of newly planted trees , 
Until we were breathing 
Before a drugstore .  We 
Entered , the tiny bell 
Bringing a saleslady 
Down a narrow aisle of goods . 
I turned to the candies 
Tiered like bleachers , 
And asked what she wanted - 
Light in her eyes , a smile 
Starting at the corners 
Of her mouth .  I fingered 
A nickel in my pocket , 
And when she lifted a chocolate 
That cost a dime , 
I didn 't say anything . 
I took the nickel from 
My pocket , then an orange , 
And set them quietly on 
The counter .  When I looked up , 
The lady 's eyes met mine , 
And held them , knowing 
Very well what it was all 
About .
Outside , 
A few cars hissing past , 
Fog hanging like old 
Coats between the trees . 
I took my girl 's hand 
in mine for two blocks , 
Then released it to let 
Her unwrap the chocolate . 
I peeled my orange 
That was so bright against 
The gray of December 
That , from some distance , 
Someone might have thought 
I was making a fire in my hands .
Key West
In the Cubano diner , tiny cups
of black , black coffee , hot and sweet ,
and chipped blue china plates
of black beans and yellowtail ,
fished by the fishermen
as the sun came up this morning .
Yesterday out on the reef ,
we looked through the floor of the boat ,
through layers of clear , clean water —
windows looking into other windows —
down to the floor of the world ,
shallow , pliant , and shifting .
There , schools of yellowtail
swam through the living coral ,
bright as stained glass ,
cast into underwater constellations
both strange and familiar :
a flower , a brain , a cathedral .
Suddenly a shadow parted the school —
as if a cloud had just blotted the sun —
a barracuda swerving as they swerved ,
and nothing they could do .
After it fed , the two halves joined ,
the missing ones unmourned ,
all as it was before .
If I could live for a thousand years ,
ten thousand , would ever I see
the great family of men , women , and children ,
both preying and preyed-upon ,
swimming as freely as the yellowtail ?
Would that be heaven or hell ?
Each naked human face a candle
joining other candles in a procession
spanning many centuries , entering
the cathedral of live stone
whose heavy doors are cast
with scenes from our own lives ,
moving as moving pictures move ,
until the reel runs out .
In that world-without-end hour ,
will the future read us in relief ,
blindly touching each raised
and burnished scene with fingertips ,
the ejaculate word forming on their lips ,
an O ! and then again an O !
of terror and astonishment ?
O how will they sing knowing what they know ?
Streaming through time , they see
our approach , we are plotted
in space , our light outlives our lives
and sends a signal far into
the future : the past is alive !
Dead and dark for a long time ,
we are as stars to them ,
stars wishing to be wished on .
There 's a mystery
By the river , in one of the cabins
Shuttered with planks , its lock
Twisted ; a bunch of magazines flipped open ,   
A body . A blanket stuffed with leaves
Or lengths of rope , an empty gin bottle .   
Put down your newspaper . Look out
Beyond the bluffs , a coal barge is passing ,   
Its deck nearly
Level with the water , where it comes back riding   
High . You start talking about nothing ,   
Or that famous party , where you went dressed   
As a river . They listen ,
The man beside you touching his odd face   
In the countertop , the woman stirring tonic   
In your glass . Down the bar the talk 's divorce ,   
The docks , the nets
Filling with branches and sour fish . Listen ,
I knew a woman who 'd poke a hole in an egg , suck   
It clean and fill the shell with gin ,
Then walk around all day disgusting people   
Until she was so drunk
The globe of gin broke in her hand . She 'd stay   
Alone at night on the boat , come back
Looking for another egg . That appeals to you , rocking   
For hours carving at a hollow stone . Or finding   
A trail by accident , walking the bluff 's
Face . You know , your friends complain . They say   
You give up only the vaguest news , and give a bakery
As your phone . Even your stories
Have no point , just lots of detail : The room
Was long and bright , small and close , angering Gaston ;   
They turned away to embrace him ; She wore   
The color out of season ,
She wore hardly anything at all ; Nobody died ; Saturday .   
These disguises of omission . Like forgetting
To say obtuse when you talk about the sun , leaving   
Off the buttons as you 're sewing up the coat . So ,   
People take the little
They know to make a marvelous stew ;
Sometimes , it even resembles you . It 's not so much   
You cover your tracks , as that they bloom
In such false directions . This way friends who awaken   
At night , beside you , awaken alone .
Traveling through the dark I found a deer 
dead on the edge of the Wilson River road .
It is usually best to roll them into the canyon :
that road is narrow ; to swerve might make more dead .
By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the car
and stood by the heap , a doe , a recent killing ;
she had stiffened already , almost cold .
I dragged her off ; she was large in the belly .
My fingers touching her side brought me the reason-- 
her side was warm ; her fawn lay there waiting , 
alive , still , never to be born .
Beside that mountain road I hesitated .
The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights ; 
under the hood purred the steady engine . 
I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red ; 
around our group I could hear the wilderness listen .
I thought hard for us all--my only swerving-- , 
then pushed her over the edge into the river .
The light along the hills in the morning
comes down slowly , naming the trees
white , then coasting the ground for stones to nominate .
Notice what this poem is not doing .
A house , a house , a barn , the old
quarry , where the river shrugs--
how much of this place is yours ?
Notice what this poem is not doing .
Every person gone has taken a stone
to hold , and catch the sun . The carving
says , " Not here , but called away . "
Notice what this poem is not doing .
The sun , the earth , the sky , all wait .
The crowns and redbirds talk . The light
along the hills has come , has found you .
Notice what this poem has not done . 
In all these rotten shops , in all this broken furniture
and wrinkled ties and baseball trophies and coffee pots
I have never seen a post-war Philco 
with the automatic eye
nor heard Ravel 's " Bolero " the way I did
in 1945 in that tiny living room
on Beechwood Boulevard , nor danced as I did
then , my knives all flashing , my hair all streaming ,
my mother red with laughter , my father cupping
his left hand under his armpit , doing the dance
of old Ukraine , the sound of his skin half drum ,
half fart , the world at last a meadow ,
the three of us whirling and singing , the three of us
screaming and falling , as if we were dying ,
as if we could never stop--in 1945--
in Pittsburgh , beautiful filthy Pittsburgh , home
of the evil Mellons , 5 ,000 miles away
from the other dancing--in Poland and Germany--
oh God of mercy , oh wild God .
That night the moon drifted over the pond ,   
turning the water to milk , and under   
the boughs of the trees , the blue trees ,   
a young woman walked , and for an instant
the future came to her :
rain falling on her husband 's grave , rain falling   
on the lawns of her children , her own mouth
filling with cold air , strangers moving into her house ,
a man in her room writing a poem , the moon drifting into it ,   
a woman strolling under its trees , thinking of death ,
thinking of him thinking of her , and the wind rising
and taking the moon and leaving the paper dark .
To stare at nothing is to learn by heart
What all of us will be swept into , and baring oneself
To the wind is feeling the ungraspable somewhere close by .
Trees can sway or be still . Day or night can be what they wish .
What we desire , more than a season or weather , is the comfort
Of being strangers , at least to ourselves . This is the crux
Of the matter . Even now we seem to be waiting for something
Whose appearance would be its vanishing--the sound , say ,
Of a few leaves falling , or just one leaf , or less .
There is no end to what we can learn . The book out there
Tells as much , and was never written with us in mind .
The hornet holds on to the curtain , winter   
sleep . Rubs her legs . Climbs the curtain .   
Behind her the cedars sleep lightly ,
like guests . But I am the guest .
The ghost cars climb the ghost highway . Even my hand   
over the page adds to the ' room tone ' : the little
constant wind . The effort of becoming . These words   
are my life . The effort
of loving the un-become . To make the suffering
visible . The un-become love : What we   
lost , a leaf , what we cherish , a leaf .
One leaf of grass . I 'm sending you this seed-pod ,
this red ribbon , my tongue ,
these two red ribbons , my mouth ,   
my other mouth ,
— but the other world-blindly I guzzle
the swimming milk of its seed field flower —
The fingers lie in the lap ,
separate , lonely , as in the field   
the separate blades of grass   
shrivel or grow tall .
We sat together in the little room ,   
the walls blotched with steam ,   
holding the baby as if the two of us
could breathe for him and were not helpless .   
Upstairs , his sister turned in her sleep   
as the phone rang —
to have wakened to a child 's cry ,   
gagged and desperate ,
and then repeat that terror when the call   
split the quiet house and centered   
its dire message :
                           a child was dead   
and his mother so wrung by grief   
she stared and stared
at the moon on its black stalk ,   
the road glistening like wire .
Rubbing the window clear of steam   
as a child rubs sleep from its eyes ,   
and looking past the fence to where
he had plunged the sled up and down the hill ,   
we could still see the holes his feet made ,   
a staggered row of graves
extracting darkness from the snow .
When morning brought the new year in ,   
the fever broke , and fresh snow   
bandaged the tracks on the hill .
For a long time we stayed in the room ,
listening to him breathe ,
like refugees who listen to the sea ,   
unable to fully rejoice , or fully grieve .
In trackless woods , it puzzled me to find
Four great rock maples seemingly aligned ,
As if they had been set out in a row
Before some house a century ago ,
To edge the property and lend some shade .
I looked to see if ancient wheels had made
Old ruts to which the trees ran parallel ,
But there were none , so far as I could tell -
There 'd been no roadway . Nor could I find the square
Depression of a cellar anywhere ,
And so I tramped on further , to survey
Amazing patterns in a hornbeam spray
Or spirals in a pine-cone , under trees
Not subject to our stiff geometries .
I was walking home down a hill near our house 
on a balmy afternoon
under the blossoms
Of the pear trees that go flamboyantly mad here 
every spring with
their burgeoning forth
When a young man turned in from a corner singing 
no it was more of
a cadenced shouting
Most of which I couldn 't catch I thought because 
the young man was
black speaking black
It didn 't matter I could tell he was making his 
song up which pleased 
me he was nice-looking
Husky dressed in some style of big pants obviously 
full of himself
hence his lyrical flowing over
We went along in the same direction then he noticed 
me there almost
beside him and " Big "
He shouted-sang " Big " and I thought how droll 
to have my height
incorporated in his song
So I smiled but the face of the young man showed nothing 
he looked
in fact pointedly away
And his song changed " I 'm not a nice person "
he chanted " I 'm not
I 'm not a nice person "
No menace was meant I gathered no particular threat
but he did want
to be certain I knew
That if my smile implied I conceived of anything like concord
between us I should forget it
That 's all nothing else happened his song became 
indecipherable to
me again he arrived
Where he was going a house where a girl in braids 
waited for him on
the porch that was all
No one saw no one heard all the unasked and 
unanswered questions
were left where they were
It occurred to me to sing back " I 'm not a nice 
person either " but I
couldn 't come up with a tune
Besides I wouldn 't have meant it nor he have believed 
it both of us
knew just where we were
In the duet we composed the equation we made 
the conventions to
which we were condemned
Sometimes it feels even when no one is there that 
someone something
is watching and listening
Someone to rectify redo remake this time again though 
no one saw nor
heard no one was there
I back the car over a soft , large object ;
hair appears on my chest in dreams .
The paperboy comes to collect
with a pit bull . Call Grandmother
and she says , Well you know
death is death and none other .
In the mornings we 're in the dark ;
even at the end of June
the zucchini keep on the sill .
Ring Grandmother for advice
and she says , O you know
I used to grow so many things .
Then there 's the frequent bleeding ,
the tender nipples , and the rot
under the floormat . If I 'm not seeing
a cold-eyed doctor it is
another gouging mechanic .
Grandmother says , Thanks to the blue rugs
and Eileen Briscoe 's elms
the house keeps cool .
Well . Then . You say Grandmother
let me just ask you this :
How does a body rise up again and rinse
her mouth from the tap . And how
does a body put in a plum tree
or lie again on top of another body
or string a trellis . Or go on drying
the flatware . Fix rainbow trout . Grout the tile .
Buy a bag of onions . Beat an egg stiff . Yes ,
how does the cat continue
to lick itself from toenail to tailhole .
And how does a body break
bread with the word when the word
has broken . Again . And . Again .
With the wine . And the loaf .
And the excellent glass
of the body . And she says ,
Even . If . The . Sky . Is . Falling .
My . Peace . Rose . Is . In . Bloom .
She was changing on the inside
it was true what had been written
The new syntax of love
both sucked and burned
The secret clung around them
She took in the smell
Walking down a road to nowhere
every sound was relevant
The sun fell behind them now
he seemed strangely moved
She would take her clothes off
for the camera
she said in plain english
but she wasn 't holding that snake
Clear night , thumb-top of a moon , a back-lit sky .
Moon-fingers lay down their same routine
On the side deck and the threshold , the white keys and the black keys .
Bird hush and bird song . A cassia flower falls .
I want to be bruised by God .
I want to be strung up in a strong light and singled out .
I want to be stretched , like music wrung from a dropped seed .   
I want to be entered and picked clean .
And the wind says “What ?” to me .
And the castor beans , with their little earrings of death , say “What ?” to me .
And the stars start out on their cold slide through the dark .   
And the gears notch and the engines wheel .
Over my head , I see the bronze butterfly ,   
Asleep on the black trunk ,
Blowing like a leaf in green shadow .   
Down the ravine behind the empty house ,   
The cowbells follow one another   
Into the distances of the afternoon .   
To my right ,
In a field of sunlight between two pines ,   
The droppings of last year 's horses   
Blaze up into golden stones .
I lean back , as the evening darkens and comes on .   
A chicken hawk floats over , looking for home .
I have wasted my life .
Just off the highway to Rochester , Minnesota ,
Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass .
And the eyes of those two Indian ponies
Darken with kindness .
They have come gladly out of the willows
To welcome my friend and me .
We step over the barbed wire into the pasture
Where they have been grazing all day , alone .
They ripple tensely , they can hardly contain their happiness   
That we have come .
They bow shyly as wet swans . They love each other .
There is no loneliness like theirs .   
At home once more ,
They begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness .   
I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms ,
For she has walked over to me   
And nuzzled my left hand .   
She is black and white ,
Her mane falls wild on her forehead ,
And the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear
That is delicate as the skin over a girl 's wrist .
Suddenly I realize
That if I stepped out of my body I would break
Into blossom .
