Falling into deep sleep as my exterior rest while my mind comes out to play.......
I appear in this room with no one around but the walls that surround me.....
I see from a distance a mist that is resting at the base of the door leading into this room...
I hear a knock and I head over to the door and open it..
And its you.......
In your jeans and your t-shirt.......
You hold a smile as you see me......
As I guide you in you keep your eye on me.....
I begin to develop chills......
My heart begins to beat on its on pace.....
Blood begins to flow and you continue to come closer......
I tell you......you don't have to if you don't want too....
Yet you insist and place your finger over my mouth so I don't talk out of being nervous.....
I place my hands on her hips....
As my feelings become true.....
This dream feels real......I don't want to wake up.....
She then places her lips on mine as I begin to continue.....
I then allow myself to become open to this one shared moment.....
As we consistently share kisses and now possible continuation........
You request for my penetration.....to connect us as one.......
Like a magnet to a fridge....I connect.....
You follow with words that sound like another type of language.....
Which makes me feel as if I am doing all the write things.....
Then we end it with a kiss and a, "I don't want this moment to end"
As we part our ways......

My name is Dr. Doofenshmirtz,
in Danville I roam.
I like to tell about myself,
in this little poem.
My nemesis is Perry the Platypus,
also known as Agent P,
I like to tell my evil plans to him,
while he likes to battle with me.
I have many annoyances,
gnomes, nature, and morning talk show hosts,
just to name a few. 
No, I'm not cookoo.
I build my new inators,
with alimony checks I get from my ex-wife.
I know they always end the same, 
but that means I'm so bright.
My brother Roger is the mayor,
I hate him everyday.
Then there is my robot Norm,
who always wants to play.
So before you leave,
I have just one thing to say.
A saying I say everyday.
I Emperor Doofenshmitz,
have to to say to all of us,
hey,
CURSE YOU PERRY THE PLATYPUS!!

How does one describe freedom,
How can one call themselves free,
How does one sleep at night knowing all the troubles that lay ahead,
If one had a choice to be free or have freedom what does one pick,
How does one even begin to describe the choices of being free,
Freedom is choice,
Freedom is happiness,
Freedom is doing what you want,
Freedom is to fly.

I know a foolish and uncaring man,
Who makes his world as empty and sad as he can.
The road that he walks is edged by a wall,
It’s not very wide and not very tall.
Over the wall there are wonderful sights,
Full of beauty, love, passion and lights.
And this foolish man knows it exists,
And he wants to be there but still he resists.
So he hopes he will grow a little more tall,
But won’t bother climbing over the wall.
And he sits to eat food that’s covered in mould,
Maggoty fruit and bread that’s days old.
But all round the table are good things to eat.
Trees laden with fruit and fields of fresh wheat.
But why bother to pick the food that tastes great,
When he’s got the moldy stuff there on a plate.
When a mantle of stars cover the land,
The foolish man stares at the palm of his hand.
His hand is familiar, so he mumbles in sorrow,
One day I’ll look up…maybe tomorrow.
Why crane my neck to look in the air.
I know the stars will always be there.

I am this man, who stares at the wall,
Desperate to climb but scared he might fall.
Who makes second best of whatever he’s got,
And gazes with love at what he has not.
So take my hand and show me what’s there,
Teach me to love, teach me to care.

All that I want
Is to be just like you
To live for the moment
Each day anew

But I am trapped
Lost in the past
Life is but shame
A line that is cast

And still I beware
A future unset
Dreading the day
The maker is met

And so I must flee
Bottle in hand
Drink the last drop
The world becomes grand

And when my head spins
And glass hits the floor
I live for the moment
My cares are no more

Wave goodbye.
Say that it was ok.
Say that it's enough.
Claim that you didn't
find what you came for.

Life is not tangible.
It slips out of your hands
just like the time.
You need time.
You don't need time.
You can't desire something that
vanishes in nothing.
Time is nonexistent.

Life's gone.
You missed your train.
You remained at the station.
And no trains come again.

Nothing stirs.
Death eats up the place.

Few words said, many untold,
Hands held in parting hold,
Much said by teary eye,
Rest by the heavy sigh,
Words weary, at it's threshold.

See the little girl dance and smile,
Twirling away through the aisle,
To be a kid, never weary,
Unburdened by haunting memory,
I wish, if only for  little while.

Lovers, four eyes but one heart,
Fingers entwined, unwilling to depart,
Tough winds carry one afar,
Further away, the closer they are,
It's not an ending, but a fresh start.

There are faces, flushed and bright,
Eager to grow wings, take flight,
Towards strange and new land,
In quest of future, fortune grand,
For isn't change the font of delight?

To rest, my friend, i'll let fears lie,
This moment as memory, never to die
Shall always keep us together,
And should you need a friend, ever,
I'll be waiting, at these gates of goodbye.

True beauty is in the way she laughs
True beauty is in her eyes
True beauty is how she acts
True beauty is inside
True beauty is unseen
True beauty is only felt
True beauty is not mean
True beauty is herself
True beauty can't be cruel
True beauty is bare
True beauty within you
True beauty is always there
True Beauty can't be covered with makeup
True beauty means true love
True beauty can't be baked up
True beauty is the flight of a dove
True beauty has no flaws
For True beauty is all that matters after all

You, you go on ahead
for a while,
I'll let myself led
for a while.

Watch you tread
the dusty paths,
shuffle your feet
in leaves and grass,
wave your arms
as you walk,
prize your charms
as you talk.
You dance with ferns
and smile at birds,
whistle, clap and chant,
as I fall behind.

You, you go on ahead
for a while,
I'll let myself led
for a while.

When your silhouette
Passes out of sight,
I light a cigarette
And I make a right.

They are worlds apart,
but they're tied together
by the thinnest thread,
stretching over oceans,
binding their emotions.

The champion, with his hair in a swirl,
and his angel-winged and holy girl,
and their thread,
as strong as he,
as beautiful as she,
levitating
when of her he thinks,
resonating
when she flaps her wings.

Silver moons belong to them.

And my idiot heart of lead
got tangled in their mighty thread,
and it melted, and it softened,
and got shredded and got blackened.

While looking back upon our lives
Now with hindsight at our strives
Does regret consume our mind?
Or do we leave the pain behind?
Do we leave the pain behind?
The trials and errors of mankind
How possible is perfection?
The aim of natural selection?
Or a concept to drive us more
To do the things that we abhor
To do the things that we abhor
But bodies weaken and minds grow sore
The person inside fades away
Colors dull to white and grey
Who I am turns to who am I?
The youthful soul’s standby
And as the youthful souls standby
All ends with an anguished sigh  
Present turns to past before you even blink
Your life no longer grows instead it merely shrinks
At the end there is one question
No repentance or confession
No judgment or condemnation
No pedestal upon which to sit
Just four words, was it worth it?

I used to have
My senses open wide
On all surrounding
Miracles and small wonders
We used to
Stare at the sky
Moon shining with certainty
And our hearts
Beat faster and faster
In awe of amazement
Now this feelings
Ale slowly perishing
Into empty void
And numb satisfaction
Desire and love
Are succumbed in sea of
Idle sadness
Great fire burns no more
Showing pair of sleepy eyes
Through ashes…

Oak leaf and cowslip and big Brussels sprouts
She's staring and daring and haring about
It's always the same when she takes the kids out
She's fretting and fussing and tutting in doubt
It's fences and hedges that bounce her around
And foxes are noxious and she hates the sound
Of their gut rotting chorus, it sings her to sleep
Then crawls to the corner to quietly weep
Please don't be deceived by the devil soft eyes
They're just her most recent and subtle disguise
She's leaf shielded, blade wielding, living revenge
Don't hound her
Don't touch her

The sun is dead, the sun is dead
And each dawn sheds a mist of tears
Upon the field where he last bled
The chill of grief condenses here

The winter wakes to frost that scars
The folded flower of my heart
My sons, my few, I'll cry for you
A film of dew upon the grass

A boy turning into a man its a scary thing worrying about things you never even cared about.
girls...
money...
cars ... and
kids...
its a scary thing when these lil boys turns into a man and only become worse looking down at his own son.
I can only stand here and pray for him a better road for him.
he needs his education that I never gave myself a chance to have.
he needs a better background that I I will brake my back for him to have.
these lil kid only understand what daddy can give but one day he will under the pain and blood that was shed for him to be the man that he is today.

I thought I saw her face today In the sparkle of the morning sun.
And then I heard the angel say Her work on earth is done
I thought I heard her voice today Then laugh her wonderful laugh.
And then I heard the angel says there's peace little one at last
I thought I felt her touch today In the breeze that rustled by.
And then I heard the angel says The spirit never dies
I thought that she had left us For the stars so far above.
And then I heard the angel say She left us with her love 
I thought that I would miss her And never find my way.
And then I heard the angel say She is with you every day

these is building inside.
these is tearing me up lil at a time.
the anger is controlling.
the poetry is helping me to calm down and breath once more.
only if I could go back and tell my self of these therapy.
these is slowly passing away.
but the therapy can only hold so long.
the anger is controlling but only when I've lost control.

The eyes of an angel
were shown to me today
Chills ran down my arms
Not knowing what to say

Behind those beautiful eyes
Lies the most lovely soul
So warm and so passionate
But not everyone knows

She made me feel special
Sweetly leading me inside
A place were our souls meet
Hearts open as we confide

Modestly she doesn't know
My heart she has stolen
Makes me soar when I'm down
Warms me when I am frozen

Those eyes shine brightly
Brilliant light in dark skies
I sit and stare motionless
In her sweet angel eyes

Life’s been changing
And Love’s not lost
I’m for rearranging
No matter the cost

I’ve always been a downer
That’s just who I am
But when I’m around her
I feel alive again

Love has hurt me before
But John Donne was only half-right
If you give enough, Love will give more
Love has the power, Love has the might

She walks in beauty
From Heaven she fell
She sees right through me
Without her it’s Hell

You may call me sappy
Or confused if you must
But in the end I’ll be happy
In the end, Love is just

Left....Left....Left....Right......Left.......
Are my feet that matches my heart beat when it comes to you.........
As corny as it may sound you are the water to my stew.....
Or the hopper to my brew.....
I cant help to notice how much I have served you
And yet I love every part of it......
Truth......
I don't mind walking you where the others wont
Just so you could know that no matter where we go I am support for you.
Just like the backbone of me and the ribs of you
I inhale the thought and feeling of us
My boys make fun of me but only because they don't have our understanding
As they continue their search for someone like you....
I have the last laugh when we lay in this bed
And I make love to you........
Dolls to a voodoo or a religion to its preacher
I am interested in you......
Pushing away the things aside and wanting to step toward what is to come to us two......

The sun still sleeps
as the forest weeps
as the mist of the morning falls
whilst beast and creature crawls

my bed lay abandoned
the furnace untended
my boots slide on my feet
and yet the sun still sleeps

into the vast wild's space
quiver strung loose at my waist
in my hand my bow I keep
and yet the sun still sleeps

to the hills, I take myself
as some, auld mystic elf
over the rise a nice, plump doe
I creep, I crawl and knock my bow

yet with the blessing of Artemis
I let loose my sliver of death
I bear the heavy hearted elation
and set my destination

I see there my prize
where she fell, and will not rise
this creature will never again creep
and yet the sun, still doth sleep

I stand here alone with you,
With deepest desire,
With hurt and with pain,
For I know, Our love is forbidden.
You look into my eyes,
I see boundaries in the reflections,
Oh, how can this be possible?
I've know love, but not like this,
Touch me now and end this sorrow,
Embrace! Let me be one with you?
Let the sunshine die and let the night be ours forever,
Let the stars be our comfort and the earth be our bed,
Let tomorrow be another day,
For now, my love, let me have this moment,
Let time stand still and let no other sound be made,
So our heart's beat as one, and our feelings be plain,
Let us love each other again.

There's a darkness in the hallway
A cold, cold silence Hangs about
Now that the final candle
Has flickered and died out.
The wind without the four walls
Turns its whisper to a weep
But neither wind nor rain can enter
Where all the sisters sleep.
Out across the moorlands
The winter's packed and gone
And springtime reigns majestic
With the first new lambs now born.
But the sisters they see nothing
There's a darkness in their eyes
Imprisoned thus forever
Nor door nor window to the skies.
Time has passed and proven
Each one equal to any man
So we treasure the web long since woven
By Charlotte, Emily and Anne.

Dawn chorus, I have woken to turn off the player,
Last night it was stopped not by chance,
The screen is the picture,
A beauty, brown skin and blue eyes,
With whom I sometimes may agree,
Love hurts,
Near me is my lassie, my girlie,
With the marvelous features,
Chocolate skin, azure eyes,
We are like cappuccino,
Clasping our dark and white hands.
The breakfast, I scan a newspaper,
Astonished, robotically say my surprise,
Instinctively, movement, why not to consider,
I speak to her wonderful eyes,
‘You know…  Mark Twain, the Finn’s story,
It’s classic… it’s silly if anything changed’…
She stops for a second,
‘I don’t know … please… let’s on anything else,’
Then quickens and advances a hip film,
We’ll be like cappuccino,
Clasping our dark and white hands.  
The evening, I drive, a jammed traffic,
The cell-phone, I’ve missed it at work,
I head for the movies,
As near as late I am dashing in foyer,
And see the forlorn azure glance,
With little tear-drops,
‘What’s happened?’
She convincingly presses herself against me,
And in low she speaks,
‘My darling, my sweet white racist,
I thought that you’d never appear near your brown lassie,’
Why, darling… oh, I get it,
We are like cappuccino,
Clasping our dark and white hands!  

The ghosts in the hall were beckoned by fear. 
The children’s dreams, silent as they watched with care. 
Silently they crept, with an occasional creak
as their weightless step echoed within the old wooden suite.
 
Moment by moment, they drew ever closer
Apparitions stalking, hunting with hunger. 
Slowly and loudly, the door opened wide
Vapors and smiles creeping inside. 
 
A child who was far from slumber
Watched with wide eyes and tried to mutter.
The others were beckoned by the look on his face
cowering in corners as they stalked without a trace. 
 
Within moments the suite was filled with screams
the dark room painted with a sinister scene
Blood was smeared, on their unseen lips
Eerie grins from their pleasure trip.

I thought I knew.......
I thought I knew that I would have a hard time getting over you.....
I guess I learning something new each day.....
Separating my heart from this page....
I would be walking in a daze.....
Guided through this maze with the sent of confusion....
Maybe this may be my souls illusion in this dilemma of mine.
I risk every time I cross paths with the opposite attractive kind.....
No need to rewind because my memories are just fine.....
Replaying in my head like an old cassette tape,
Yet I cant erase the time I seen you....
I do everything right but do one thing wrong that towers over all my actions....
No I have never cheated and nor do I believe in such a thing,
I am old fashion soul that is open to what the world brings.....
But not this heart ache....
That I absorb through my pours in these days of misunderstanding.
All I want is someone of my type that I believe I deserve....
I wish it was her......
Only her that would make me smile daily.......

Do you remember that sunny day?
It was early spring, in that little street
I rambled along and watched the windows
and the colorful textiles in that shop...
I turned in and my fingers played on those
many fine fabrics, the dust was floating in the air --
I saw it clearly in the sunlight, in the beams,
and out there in the street I took a deep breath
when I stepped out again into the freshness.
And we knew that you'll be here...
Something drew you near.
Sunshine whispered in your ear...

Just so you know I think about you sometimes.

 Sometimes I cry.  Other times I yell at the pictures of you. Sometimes I yell at myself for crying about you. 

Sometimes I curl up in my bed and pretend that you’re holding me.  Sometimes I punch my pillow pretending it’s your face.  

Sometimes I walk with the independence knowing that I don’t need you.  Sometimes it hurts so much I can’t stand.

Sometimes I look in the mirror and see beauty that you took for granted.  Sometimes I look in the mirror and get lost in the sadness in my eyes.

Sometimes I walk and daydream about the life we could have had together.  Sometimes I wish I had never met you.

Sometimes I let my girlfriends hold me and tell me I don’t deserve this.  Sometimes I can tell myself.

Sometimes I fall into another man’s arms.  Sometimes I fall in love with you all over again.

Sometimes I smile about the good times.  Sometimes I die on the inside when I simply remember your smile.

Sometimes I listen to our song and sing along.  Sometimes I can’t get out the words in-between sobs.

Sometimes I look at you and wonder why you didn’t treat me right.  Sometimes I just look at you, wishing you would take the time to treat me in any way you wanted as long as you looked back at me.

Sometimes I wonder if you ever think about me too. 

Life, it full of all sorta  pain
It ones big game
Different but always the same
Don’t try to control it
Just take the hits and roll with it
Filled with this love and this hate
 Don’t be Afraid to leave the starting gate
Never Try too hard, take a step back, disengage
There is just some things you learn with age
Learn to live with sorrow
Bite your lip and pray for tomorrow
It’s not always pretty
When you get down to the nitty gritty
Gotta know you’re not always in control
Seems like god always favor an asshole
There is one thing you need to get
So you’re not stuck with regret
Life will just be selfless
Till you realize you’re helpless
And that
What doesn’t kill you makes your stronger
Dig deep you can last a little longer
You’re going to get pushed and shoved
Going to get kicked and loved
Filled with terror, by those who pretend to care
Don’t rush those that try to conceal
Don’t make an ordeal
Just wait till they reveal
What you get is all real
Nothing left to peel
Just listen to what your feel
And even if you feel that your done
With pressure that weighs a ton
You will make it in the long run
Remembering you are my number one

Never be afraid to cry
It is apologizing to the 1 in the sky
It is simply just a tear
It doesn’t show any fear
It doesn’t mean you are weak
Doesn’t mean you’re a freak
So Come cry in my arm
In here you are safe from harm
I am the barrier for the hate
Come on in you know I can relate
Let your tears be acid rain
It’s alright you don’t have to explain
I know the tears destroy the wall of sorrow
Just take my hand and follow
I want you to know what I’d do for you
With me just imagine what you can get through
I’ll make your pain my pain
And I won’t complain
If your tears make a stain
Because imagining life without you makes me insane

My heart is always changing
Broken and Ripped
Rearranged and Exchanged
Torn and chipped
By people who judge and hate
So I guard my bleeding heart
And I lock it up behind a gate
As it gets torn apart
But I never feel a threat
With my heart in your hands
I cannot fret
Its locked on tight with loving bands
I always know you will be there
With your healing words that work like glue
I can no longer see a rip or tear
When my heart is being guarded by you
You go past the outer shell of my heart
Dive deep into unknown lands
Reshape it into a work of art
Because you are the one that understands
When It is open for you I feel love and Grace
I don’t worry about my pride or my place
I forget all about the scars of hate
Because I am surrounded by this feeling you create

It’s  that time of the season
I always feel alone
To be unhappy is treason
But I like to moan

Christmas is never fun
Christmas is always sad
And I’ve got a feeling
I want to be so bad
So go down that alcohol
Kiss the forbidden girl
This year won’t be dull
This year won’t be dull
Christmas is never fun
Christmas is always hell
And I’ve got a dodgy feeling
This one will be boring as well
It’s that time of the season
The TV is blank
And I’ve got a reason
To be a total crank

Christmas is never fun
Christmas is always sad
And I’ve got a feeling
I want to be so bad
So go down that alcohol
Kiss the forbidden girl
This year won’t be dull
This year won’t be dull
Christmas is never fun
Christmas is always hell
And I’ve got a dodgy feeling
This one will be boring as well

It’s that time of season
The turkey is dry
Yuletide is a lesion
Upon my tired eyes 
Christmas is never fun
Christmas is always sad
And I’ve got a feeling
I want to be so bad
So go down that alcohol
Kiss the forbidden girl
This year won’t be dull
This year won’t be dull
Christmas is never fun
Christmas is always hell
And I’ve got a dodgy feeling
This one will be boring as well

Everybody Likes My Clock
It doesn’t tick and it doesn’t tock
Its’ digital hi-tech stuff
It tries it’s best to spread some love

Everybody likes my clock
Every day I change the font
Darker lines, squiggly bits
Sometimes it’s great, sometimes it’s shit

Everybody likes my clock
It’s always there, that’s not shock
It’s become a big part of me
Reminds me of my mortality

Time, time, precious time
Won’t you make all of it mine?
To do with it as I please
To put the leaves back on the trees

Everybody likes my clock
It turned Dylan from folk to rock
It’s influence is all around
Still it doesn’t make a sound

Down by the coffee machine, Caroline’s there
With her moles and her mousy hair
Her bouncing chest and her sparkling eyes
Her wicked smile that cuts through my lies
I try my hardest not to leer
But it’s difficult when someone’s as intriguing as her
I nearly fell
I nearly fell
I nearly fell

Gayle sat next to me today
No work, no rest, only play
Not much to do around here
You’ve got to have a laugh when someone pretty is sat near
I notice her forehead and her long flowing hair
I am scared that I’m beginning to care
I nearly fell
I nearly fell
I nearly fell

I’ve found I’m lying in Anna’s bed
I wonder what’s going on in her head
Does she really want me here?
Does she, in any way, consider me dear?
I think I’ll leave, I know I should
I got up and went as quick as I could
I nearly fell
I nearly fell
I nearly fell

15 months and one begins to feel better. 
Something new has come along, something beautiful.
Something one wishes to help them forget the past.
You hold on, and close your eyes, embracing a new life.
Yet, the past is burned into the eyelids, and the memories flood back.
Do I really want to forget what once was...?
Am I truly happy...?
15 months and one thinks they begin to fell better.... 

My leaves are falling
Dying
My branches are bare
I crave the sunshine
The blooms
But I grasp nothing but air. 

Now I must lay my demons to rest,
no longer can I deny my own guilt.
This sorrow that tears my soul apart,
seeps in from a world I helped to build.
Deceit, treachery and cowardly lies,
weren't just actions of others,
they were also mine.
Now scars self inflicted I carry with me,
scars I know will never fade away.
With a remorseless mind I took what I liked,
in the devils playground I chose to play.
With my decadence, weakness and senseless hate,
I do nothing,
nothing except for seal my own fate.
I rise from this dark tomb in which I laid myself to rest,
I can feel myself coming back to life.
I see the path I feel I must follow,
and now I have the strength to do what I know is right.
Although its down this path I have chosen,
it is in the good deeds I do, I know I will pay my price.
I'll take the shit I have dealt,
my punishment, I know I must.
Because of my actions,
the rewards I receive will be clouded with distrust.
The demons I'll banish,
but the scars will stay,
to remind me,
I must never turn back to my old ways.

A magic moment I remember, I looked
up and saw you standing there.
An Angelic vision and living proof
of all that are beautiful and rare.

My breath was completely taken from me,
goings on around me I did not care.
For I was totally spellbound by you, all
I could do was stand there and stare.

As I stood there agape and stared at you,
with so much noise and activity around.
All I heard was silence, my heartbeat
being the only audible sound.

Who was this beauty so elegant and
graceful moving across the floor?
And how could something so wonderful 
exist without me ever seeing her before?

So many emotions washed over me that day,
I didn't understand but I would soon see.
From that very moment I saw my soul mate,
I knew every thing you*d ever mean to me.

For that day I learned how love felt, and
from that day on I would love and adore.
That vision who was shopping with her mother
and sister in our home town grocery store.

My sister was my life.
She’s with God now and looks down.
Wondering if I will ever stand my ground.
Stop worrying, she says out loud.
Take care of your family, take care of you.
Love yourself and things will come thru.
Live life full and you will see.
That one day your life will change and you
Will be happy.
Believe in our Father.
For He knows what you need.
Believe me sis, you will succeed.
So my darling sis, look up in the sky.
Remember one day your soul will fly.
We will be together you will see.
Please be happy and take care of your family.
With all my love from me to you.
Kiss mom and dad and all the kids too.
Goodnight my sis; please be strong.
Just remember you’re never alone.
One last time I say goodbye and please, my sis never cry.
I’m here for you night and day.
God bless you sis; now its time to pray.

Thank you for thy love
that gave my life a start,
For thy gentle touch
that gave my life a start.
Thank you for thy hands
where my hope lies in,
For thy shoulder of comfort
where I could always lean.
With my deepest love & affection
I wrote this poem to thee,
So that you might know
how much you mean to me.  

Precious Lord Take My Hand
Lead me Lord to the right man
My heart is broke. My mind is weak 
And my body is worn. Through the Mr. Right knows and in spite of the fun. 
I'm still Lord without no one
So Lord hear my cry hear my pleas
Send that Sexy Man Of God (SMOG) to me.
And when he comes Lord let me know
Let him come right through my door.
Hands out and heart filled with love
And stamped: "Straight From Heaven Above"

Signed, Sealed, Delivered!!!! 

Love comes from above,
in the heart from the start,
once you love someone,
you never for get them.
It gets faster and faster,
and then one day you say something,
so they try to forget you.
But you can*t erase all the words you say,
so you have to go another way,
then one day you meet a new true love.
Your heart solars above like a dove,
in the sky way up high,
it takes off with a leaping jump,
and my heart goes thumpity, thump, thump.
I jump around when I see your smile,
when we are together for a while.   

“The most precious thing”, 
and so we say…
though why do millions die,
everyday?

From murders to rapists, 
from guns to knives,
we hurt each other
and destroy their lives.

Wars and disputes, 
weapons and graves, 
we say we want to help,
though we live in our caves.

If we wish to live life,
we must do our part,
we must look deep within,
into our heart.

Life was a gift,
we must live it to the best
we must enjoy our time,
the time we have left…..

Life was a word,
a word that meant joy,
is there life anymore?
for any girl or boy…  

When your growing up you should keep this in mind,
When it comes to boys don’t always be kind.
A one-night stand is the worst thing to do,
Because more often then not, they wont respect you.

Do not get wasted and go to the club,
You’ll act like a fool when you’re drunk at a pub.
It’s not a good thing when you have too much to drink,
Bad things can happen because you don’t often think.

You could be having the greatest night,
But one wrong move and your into a fight.
Flashbacks the next day will make you shame,
You’ll hang your head low with no one to blame.

When you’re drunk you act foolish, and you simply wont care,
But what you remember tomorrow, is the hardest to bare.
You’ll stager in front of people and sometimes fall to the ground,
And before you know it no one wants you around.

But you’ll go out and get drunk again and again,
You’ll look like a tart, and act just the same.
Guys will try to take advantage of you,
Stupidly thinking its okay because you’re blue.

You can have fun, talk to people and smile,
When you’re well behaved, it makes last night worthwhile.
Know when you’ve had enough and quit while your ahead,
Have a good feed and then go home to bed.

People will think you’re a drunk, and a hopeless case,
Don’t make that mistake and drink at a pace.
Have respect for yourself and always take care,
Because tomorrows hangover is the hardest to bare. 

Someone asked me today "Why do You love him so?"	
And I said. I love him for the smile he gives me and 
the way he gazes into my eyes with that crocked little smile.	
That's why I Love him so.	

I love him for the pride he taught me to stand up for my 
beliefs, and if I ever had to do it again I would say Yes 
a thousand times.	

I love him for the little jokes he cracks to make me laugh
Because before he is happy or comfortable he makes sure I am too.
I love him for him just as he loves me for me.

I love you for who you are and you are the Love of my Life. You can 
not change your
life, but you can change the way it's lived. I am your wife and that 
I'm glad to be.
Not a sole on this earth can change the way I feel about you and me.

The way I feel for you is beyond words
The way I feel when I'm around you is hard to explain
My voice lowers, my heart speeds
yet you cause me so much pain
Sometimes I dream about you and wish you were
mine
My love growing stronger and stronger with time
You put me down but I still want you
You turn me away but I need you
You hurt me with your words, but why?
You tear my heart to shreds but I refuse to die
I try to break away, but my mind says no
My friends tell me to follow my heart
But how can I do this when you've tore it apart
I'm confused
Should I stay, Should I go?
I like you and I don't know why
Wether it's your smile or the way you walk
Something about you makes me melt inside
Every time I hear your voice my heart stops beating
Yet you spit in my face and turn me away like I*m not worth keeping
The way I feel for you, can*t be explained
But yet you treat me like dirt, call me out my name
When we're alone I see a spark in your eyes
But when your with your boys that spark dwindles and dies
You say nothing good about me, everything you
say is a lie
That's when I knew I had to tell you goodbye
You don't even care how I feel
The hurt you cause within, no I'm not gonna cry, I'm not gonna shed a 
tear for are love has gone and you have made that real clear
but yet I have love for you, why? I don't know
But, it's more love than I can bear
My heart still wants to love you, but It's afraid of what you might 
do
The pain you might cause
I still have love for you, I always will
But I'm gonna let you go
I have to
But you will forever be my first, nobody above
Forever in my heart, you were my First Love

You are always in my thoughts 
Day and night, here and there
You are always in my dream
When I visibly sleep
Your Image never fades in my heart
Even when you are gone
The scent of you 
Still in my palms
The pleasant words you say
Still in my memory
When we are apart like this 
Life is not fair enough
I know you are only gone for a while and will back in a short while
But ahead of that, know that I truly care
And missing you thoughtfully 

It was a dark and stormy night,
The air was still, and full of fright,
off in the distance I could see,
a dark figure moving, getting closer to me,
then I realized my time was done,
it was the grim reaper, he had won.
Now that my time on earth is through,
I guess I have nothing else to do.
Just remember the things in the past,
because life was never meant to last.
So live each day as if it were through,
this way you will never leave anything, left to do.

A wail of thunder,
Echo’s through the dark shanty village,
The sound of whispers,
Hums like a lullaby,
Beneath this atmosphere,
A new life is brought down to earth,
The tears of the mother,
The pride of the father,
Foresees his future
Wrapped in white; he’s brought out,
Only to recognize his meaningless future,
Future of poverty,
Future of tears,
Only to be lived by those without fear,
Stumbling and tumbling he grows up,
Only to befriend sorrows and tears,
No love shown on him,
No happiness booned to him,
Hardship was his life,
POVERTY was his name.

I hear a car door slam.
As I lie awake in bed.
I know now that you’re hear.
A single tear is shed.

I sense what will occur,
When you stumble through the door.
You’ll take it out on her,
Then leave her shattered on the floor.

She’ll pick herself back up again,
Then come into my room.
And tell me that she can sustain.
All your binding doom.

But I know it’s not the truth,
She’s slowly dying inside.
You’re taking away her youth,
While she swallows all her pride.

I know she thinks of running away,
But she realizes it’s no use.
There will be a price to pay,
And it will end in more abuse.

No, this poem does not rhyme;
it isn't meant to,
for this poem speaks of truth
as it speaks of love.
Many people try to picture love;
what it looks like,
what it feels like,
and if he/she will ever find it.
but the truth is-
you really don't have to look for it.
you've already found it.
You've had it since the day you were born,
most people just think they don't have it
but only because they have too much of it;
As us humans do have a tendency to ignore what we already have,
take it for granted-
nay, throw it all away
because we are, as so, consumed by greed, as even myself.
I suppose you want to know what love really looks like?
What love really feels like?
And if you will ever find it?
Well, when these questions find themselves swimming in your thoughts,
just remember you already have it.
God gave us love to give it.
He gave us feeling so that when it is given to us, we may receive it,
so that we may enjoy it.
He gave it to us,
so that we may not waste away searching for it, and we could spend our 
lives using the gifts he gave us.
Now, the only question left, is whether you are going to choose to 
continue to ignore it, spend your entire life, the one true gift God gave 
you, searching for what you already possess- 
or whether you are going to finally stop throwing it away and start 
anew, see God and the truth of true love, and start doing what you were 
intended to do-
Start giving the love you were given.

I'm so sorry for hurting you but it was the least I could do
Our friends were telling lies that made us not want to look in to each 
others eyes...
Now I ask just take me back so we can relive our loving past...
My love for you will never end...
Its not over between the bend in our hearts...
So I ask today take me back...for I am not a hack...
I am the one who loves you with all my heart...
The one who will write you an e-mail once a day to show you how much I 
love you...
So take me back so I can live another day cause without you I'm not 
ok...
I have no meaning without you in my life...
It seems pointless to go another day...
But I know that there is always that one chance you will take me 
back...
So my heart doesn't move on...
Because I no my love will win you back

A friend is there when you’re feeling down
To give you a smile
When you’re wearing a frown

A friend is there to guide you through
All the tests
You thought you knew

A friend is there to take you along
And tell you that
You can go on

A friend is one whom you can depend
That will be there
Until the very end

A friend is there to release your fear
A friend is somehow always near

Oh! How beautiful it is to sit in the Garden;
It is so fascinating to watch the trees dancing with soft and cool 
breath 
Of the winter wind;
And it is relaxing to listen to the soft music of the water falls 
and the sweet voices of the birds;
And it*s so wonderful to gaze at the mysterious beauty of the sky;

Oh! I feel good resting in the Garden 
As I am surrounded with green plants and trees;
But, how I wish that I would see lots of flowers with variety of colors 
and scents
until the next time I would visit the Garden;

After each day of my work, in this beautiful weather, I am looking 
forward 
To sit and observe the beauty and cleanliness of the Garden
As it makes me calm, comfortable and it meditates my soul.

Oh, this day is finally through.
The only thing I want to do,
Is crawl into bed and wallow.
Hoping sleep is soon to follow.

But thoughts begin to filter in.
They seem so fickle to begin.
Errands needing to be run.
Pay this now and that needs done.

I feel myself drifting off,
But interrupted with a cough.
Just enough to open up the door.
Setting off the thoughts once more.

I can’t help the tossing and the turning
Peaceful thoughts is what I’m yearning.
Slumber’s avoiding me it seems.
Losing hope of soothing dreams.

I look at the clock in fright.
Wishing I could end my plight.
These thoughts are not concluding.
Why is sleep so eluding?

The clock is now showing three.
Please worries won’t you let me be.
Glancing at the clock I sigh.
Feeling myself want to cry.

Those hours flew by way too fast.
Slumber’s finding me at last.
Just a few hours till I wake.
But that’s all I get to take.

The moment arriving that I dread.
I have to get up and out of bed.
Even though the hours were few,
I have a lot of things to do.

Oh, this day is finally through.
The only thing I want to do,
Is crawl into bed and wallow.
Hoping sleep is soon to follow.

So, there you were...
a figure of resonant vibrations,
whispering hymns replete with passion,
like a phoenix heralded by the tides,
relentlessly flying through the skies.

And there I was...
a searching shadow at sundown,
a sojourner on a forlorn mound,
streamlined with fallible innocence,
yielding with resisting acquiescence.

Then Cupid struck my heart...
Oh! My heart liquified with fervor,
oblivious to other people’s rancor,
forbearing the torments of reality,
I was swept with a love fantasy.

A realization suddenly rocked my core,
staggering my brains out and shaking my soul,
as pang vanquishes all that’s left in me,
captivating my dreams into a vain reality.

Then my spirit languished
and my body, lifeless of a broken heart;
I realized your love was never mine 
right from the very start.

I’ve dwelt in torment`
Self-inflicted & karma driven,
Not quiet in my lament`
Warning you from the beginning;

Of the totality`
In my dysfunction,
Fortified reality`
You see no illusion;

Yet now chaotic`
It surrounds us,
And becomes hypnotic`
No controlling this;

Your change in mind`
My heart in ruins,
Your strength now blind`
No longer fluent;

Holding fast`
But losing ground,
Once meant to last`
Now falling down !

Leaves has fallen from the trees
Just like those of my captured dreams
Strong wind keeps on crushing me down
Baffled by a voice whispering so loud

Flowers were destroyed by the stranger
Now miracles were placed more farther
Fragrance poisoned my vision
Cursed with a life that will never go on

The sun lightens up the whole sky
Telling me when’s the right time
Dark clouds keep oneself back
Precluding chances that lived through others luck

A garden full of glittering treasures
Dreams surrounded by blunders so pure
Only shattered reveries grow in this place
And peace can never be displayed.

I got up today I was thinking of you
The day we walked down the aisle to say our I do’s 
Water was falling but not from our eyes 
One single drop fell from the sky

God was showing us things could be tough
Life is not easy and things can get rough 
Days will be happy and days will sad 
We will love each other and sometimes get mad

Sometimes were together sometimes were apart 
When I am alone you’re in my heart
We had two kids that took most our time 
When we get older things will be fine

I see us sitting under a tree still deeply in love 
Cause God sent you to me from above 

My heart bleeds for the hungry children who’ve been dying
The hopeless mothers who’ve been crying
Thy guy who got killed by his blood brother
The kids with no shelter in the hot and cold weather
The people who got robed in broad day light
The little girls who got raped day and night
The father who watched and put up no fight
The never knowing what’s next meal kids
The forever ill kids
The old man who got caught up in the war
My heart bleeds for you sir

My heart bleeds for you

My heart bleeds for the mother who’s been terrorized
The mother who’s been paralyzed
The mother who couldn’t provide for her own kids
The mother who taught us to do good deeds
The mother who raised the good children and the bad
The mother who showered with her children’s blood
The mother who was once very happy but now sad
The mother who became blind from crying daily
The mother who was always friendly 
The mother who’s also known as somalia
My heart bleeds for you mama mia

My heart bleeds for you

We’d be sad because someone would die
Or we can be happy because a friend just became a bride.

Time Show’s its age
Like a bird in a Cage.

We are stuck in a lifetime
such as when a person is put in jail by doing a crime.

Time can put us in our place

A king could just be sitting in a room
and next he would be dead in a tomb

when we meet a new person in high school we can say hi,
but right at graduation we have to say goodbye.

In a dark room we’d be overcome with fright
and wake up with a bright light.

Is it really love? 
or is it just a passing feeling
am I not convinced?
a bit uncertain of the feeling

Is it the way you make me feel?
so warm with joy and laughter
or could it be the happiness
from moments spent together

The lasting bliss, the kiss I miss,
The sweetest thoughts without a touch
The heart that hurts and bears a scar
thinking how far away you are

You’re on my mind most of the day
And at night I go to bed and pray
An angel soft and gentle as you
Would make my sweetest dreams come true

Thinking about you alone or in class
Writing your name on my bathroom window glass
Wishing you were here
To love hold and care
Wishing I had you with me
To cherish and to stare

Into your soft and beautiful eyes
As we both travel to the skies
And mingle with the stars above
But is it really love?

You know the feeling, 
when you see that one girl you really like. But yet, 
you see a man holding her hand,
and kissing her lips, 
and holding her waist. 
And ALL you can do is think. 
Think of the things you’d do for her,
think of the things that the future may hold. 
And all you feel, 
is your heart dropping to the floor,
all you feel is getting goosebumps going up and down your spine. 
And all you can do. 
Is talk All you can do is wait, and see. And in the end, it ends up 
being another man, same story. 

This poem could never amount to be
The love and courage you once gave to me.
I cannot even begin to say 
The happiness you caused to me that one glorious day.

This new restored hope,
A resurrection within,
A new beautiful story is about to begin.

Your presence is soothing,
Your touch is caress.
This new learned yearning for nothing more, nothing less.
Your touch says you’ll hold me, guard me, 
and always stay by my side,
So there is where I’ll want to reside

Your laugh is contagious, as is you charming smile,
I could think of you and easily run - more than sixty miles.
I want to thank you for letting me be,
Myself when I’m around you, 
Nobody, but me.

I have built a great wall around my sore heart,
And you took it down, and tore it apart.
Somehow you got through, you got through to me,
Oh, how lovely the chorus of sweet jubilee.

I think about you every time,
I think about you all the time.
I wish this haunting would go away,
unless this love was returned.
This love that keeps loving,
with nothing, but yearning,
a yearning to be yearned, 
to be missed loved,
and adored.

I want to be wanted,
like I do for you.
I wish to know of your feelings,
’cause I haven’t a clue. 

Do you think about me every time,
all the time?
Do you go crazy wanting to know?
Are you a hopeless wreck that needs to be needed?
Do you wish to scream out and let that whole world know?
Do your days fly by without your knowing?
Does your mind go astray thinking of me?
Do you have this same feeling that doesn’t seem to stop growing?
Do you ever have urges of wanting to know?

Do you feel for me,
the way I feel for you?

Adoption is Love
Adoption is a gift from above
It’s better than all things
Love comes to you with fast wings
Adoption is never done!
Adoption is more than fun
It’s sweeter than candy
it may even come in handy.
If you’re adopted, and don’t like it at all
Consider you’re blessed, because it’s the greatest gift of all.

Sometimes I feel
That I hate the man
Who helped me bring
Kids to this land
He cheated on me
With my best friend
And said he still loved me
But wanted us to end
He spent three years
Trying to find out
If he was to stay
With her or without
He left me with two
Kids to care for
And felt that the family
Life was a bore
Now he is
To spend the eternity
Feeling with guilt
And without purity
The kids and I
Are now the happiest
In walked a man
Who is the manliest
He watches over
The kids and me
Without any regrets
And full of glee
I now am happy
But can’t say the same
For the man who walked out
Without no shame
For him and his girlfriend
I thank them for all
They both took the old me
And made me fall
But now I’m the strongest
In body and soul
For now my heart
Is brought back to whole
So now I’m done
Telling the story
That led me to life
Full of glory

What was she to do when you went away? 
Sit on her bed and just sing? 
Nothing but you was on her mind every day
every time she looked on her finger that had no ring.

She gave you her heart
and you pushed it around
She should have known better right from the start.
you just took her heart and slammed it on the ground.

You throw away everything that she made
you never did this before
how could you make someone lay where she laid? 
she gave you her all, why didn’t you just love her more? 

she thought what you guys had was sweet
but you had to walk out and left her incomplete.

I saw a girl the other day; 
she looked very sad. 
Her face was drawn and pale, 
her eyes were red and puffy from many tears. 
There were still tears in her eyes yet unshed 
as I stared. 
Her cheeks were hollow and colorless, 
she was nothing special to look at. 
In her eyes was the look of loneliness, the absence of passion. 
At the instant I saw it, the sadness was gone; 
in its place: cold acceptance. 
I wanted to tell her the sorrow wouldn’t last, 
but when I stretched out my hand, only my reflection reached back.

Take this kiss upon the brow!
and, in parting from you now 
thus much let me avow-
you are not wrong, who deem
that my days have been a dream
yet if hop has flown away 
in a night or in a day 
in a vision or in none
is it therefore the less
gone all that we see to 
seem is but a dream within a
dream I stand amid the roar 
of a surf- tormented shore
and I hold within my hand
grains of golden sand how
few! yet how they creep
though my fingers to 
deep while I weep -while 
I weep o god! can I not save
one from the pitiless wave?
is all that we see or seem 
but a dream within a dream?

I’m tired of waiting
waiting for you to call
waiting for you to do
anything at all.
You’re terribly tempting,
yet here I am waiting, and always thinking of you.
I want you to stay,
and stand here by me tall...
but that’s not what happens,
no baby nothing at all.
You walk by and smile I cherish the view,
There’s nothing to do, but sit around waiting for you.
I’m 
I’m tired of waiting,
my body is aching.
I’m starting to lose hope, I’m giving up within.
If you want me at all, you’d better act fast,
or I’m moving on and forgetting the past.
Not like anything happened,
It was nothing but dreams,
But Please try and hurry, before I slip downstream.
Hasten the pace, you’re long overdue
but I like you that much, I’ll wait forever for you.

People sacrifice their lives everyday
so our countries freedom will stay.
They work so hard to reach that goal
some will die and leave their families with an empty soul.
Hearing the sound of children crying.
Nurses running around trying to save lives
war is like sharp knives.
It’s so hard not to think about how they must feel.
All of those innocent people that the enemies kill.
They have helped us be where we are today
and hopefully it will stay that way.

Peering through the window, water apple leaves
sway with the breeze; dancers of the night
with green veined fingers cast quirky shadows
against the cream-colored concrete walls.

Beneath them, I turn to the porcelain cup 
in my hands, whirling the tinted water of 
fresh picked tea leaves invisible under steam
before lushing up to quench my thirst.

I look up and marvel 
as succulent water apples 
bounce back and forth
from their wellspring
like little children 
playing tug-of-war.

It’s an ingenuous spectacle 
of swollen receptacles and 
calluses on chlorophyll clothes
and cellulose accessories.

With the wind swatting their soft skins, 
I wonder how they held on
and remained firm with every blow.
Wouldn’t they want to be free 
and relish liberty on the ground? 

I lay my back on a soft cushion 
as the reality finally convinces me 
life --
in its bare simplicity.
I simply smile.

Fresh sunbeams scald my face, 
as I trot the shore 
of a long forgotten past.

Waves shiver and hiss toward me
like it always had...years ago,
when he was still here
beside me, hand in hand.

On this island,
memories were carved not 
on mortal minds but on the sea
who was a witness to it all.

From love’s delight 
to broken promises,
fate took its plight
at every turn.

Swan-necked waves 
used to spring up so high
and slither back to its hub
when we first exchanged 
our vows of love.

I remember the sunshine 
playing with our toes
when we kicked sand and stones
to form castles in the wind.

Like little children
we were so free
on our little heaven
we thought would be forever.

I turn and watch once more
as the tide ebbs slowly
leaving the rocky sand 
dry and sparkling under my feet.

It’s summer once again
and thoughts of him
shatter in my head
like the ebbing waves.

It was on this island
where our love started to bloom;
but like flowers that bloom and die
so did our love...

what it would be,
if I never found you.
what will it be
if you had not found me.
will it be the same,
I wonder,
an ain't answer,
could the dime,
give the thyme.
you came like an angel,
and brighten the days,
you gone like the wind,
when my heart had fill with grace.
will you come back again,
thats all I could wish,
will the wish be in my dreams,
I wonder?
I wish you had not gone,
but I could fill your soul had not gone.

I know I'm the reason for all your problems
I know I'm the one who caused them
I know I'm the one that doesn’t do things right
I know I don’t always get my way
I know I deserve all those mean things you say
I know I'm the one always ruining your day
But baby listen to what I gotta say
I'm sorry for all the shit I’ve done
Yea baby I know it was dumb but all I wanted to do was have fun
I know you get mad when you find out what I did
I know you think I'm acting like a little kid
I know I'm the reason we fell apart
I know I'm the reason for your broken heart
I know that these are your worse fears
And I know I'm not the one suppose to be shedding these tears
I know I'm cause for your pain and hurt
I know I'm the reason you always feel like dirt
I know if I would have tired we would have made it
But if I knew this would happen I would have stayed with it
You think I don’t care but I do cause to find a good man like is rare
I know you don’t know what to do with me
But be patience listen,and wait and see
I don’t know about some things you do
But I do know that I love you

The way that you left me hurt me more than anything
I don’t understand how our love fell apart
You knew how to get to me and what hurt my heart
You took advantage of my emotional ways and ripped me apart
I still think of you although I try to keep you off my mind
I will never forget you I thought you were one of a kind
All boys are the same because they all want one thing
It makes me mad that I let myself end up like this
Knowing good and well that it was all too good to be true
I still hoped for more than this
I don’t see how this ended like this and in this way
It hurts my heart and makes me cry
I cry
And cry
And cry, and then I think of how mean you were to me
You would lie and cheat and tell me you loved me
But were they all lies? Was it just a joke?
I will never know
All I know is that I have done the right thing
I said goodbye to you and your conceded ways
All you thought about was yourself
And the result of that ends good for you
Because now your just like you were before a young dumb girl fell for 
you
Alone
Like you will be until you find someone else
That’s stupid like I was
And thinks that you love her
When really all you want is to break her heart
Shit gets said and let go
Because I didn’t want you to be mad at me
But in the end I see…it was never me
It was you
You were the one that lost in the end
You lost in your own little pitiful game
And now I sit and smile
Laugh
And think about you
Being such a jerk
And how I deserve so much better
Now I want to thank you
You helped me realize how much better I can do
So thanks
And 
... you 

Sitting here, thinking of you,
About how you do the things that you do.
Knowing that we were supposed to be,
But when I look in your eyes, It’s not me that you see.
The thoughts that keep showing, up in my head,
Are making me run,crying,back to my bed.
The visions of you, that I can still see,
Can’t stop the hurt from swelling inside of me.
Thinking of times when you made me laugh,
The memories of you, come rushing back.
Now I go back, and I reminisce, 
I guess I'm still waiting for true loves first kiss....... 

A lifetime filled with cheating hearts, 
all echo from my past, 
The "promise trues" and "I love you’s," 
each one was meant to last. 
So fine this line of sharing, 
built with honesty and trust, 
Each vow now left inside my head, 
to slowly gather dust. 
I struggle to tomorrow, searching hope, 
yet walking blind, 
While broken dreams, and silent screams, 
play re-runs in my mind. 
I try to shake, each past mistake, 
and meet what lies ahead, 
While hearing cold reminders 
of these promises once said. 
It’s hard to feel, what’s wrong from real, 
when shadows dim the light, 
I close my eyes and dream a dream 
of heaven every night. 
Is all I know, this history I hold 
a guiding hand? 
These scars I show, 
a lesson that I yet don’t understand? 
Another day away Love Without Good-byes

There’s a coast, a westward shore, a beach where in my mind
The sunset, ebb and tide, and every wave to its zenith climbs
Where swells and crests collide to redefine serenity’s design
And oceans of hope form by a love seeming altogether right

The windows of beachfront homes do not present time ordinarily
Each crash and pulsing of the sea breaks boredom's monotony
And the spray salting the air becomes spice to both top and lower lip
Making each kiss long, lasting, and lucid over the whole of days lived

The picket fence won’t stand against the wind’s fierce persistence
Paint and style weather's wear will strip from a home’s elegant finish
And glass panes will be scratched and scraped by sand blown days
Till its foundation some morning cedes to erosion and coastal rains

But I will always feel the same about you when the tides roll in
When my dreams be swept away, will I be washed away with you?

You look into my eyes and see I’m in pain
It’s as if you have nothing to lose nothing to gain
I am no one special but your still here
And for some reason you’re my number one fear
Trusting you takes a lot from me
But trust is the most important key
I feel like I need you to live
But I have nothing to offer you or give
I’m not worth it I’m no one at all
you might as well just watch me as I fall
My world will be smashed
My dreams are already crashed
You shouldn’t waste your time with me like this
I’m no one that you’re going to miss
I’m filled with pain and filled with sorrow
I don’t know why I bother living for tomorrow
Empty is all that I am and all I will ever be
It really isn’t that hard to see
I’m dead on the inside and I cry
It’s caused from lie after lie
Your trying to save me but there’s no use
My emotions are all over it feels like abuse
As I sit here wanting to die
You stand there not willing to say goodbye

Why am I standing at your door?
Looking up at the sky that heavily pours,
Watching the rain fall to the grass,
Looking at the cars slowly pass,

Pounding at the door do loud,
Screaming, crying and yelling loud,
Seeing the shadows creep,
Under the door with out a peep,

So why do you feel so happy like about this,
Breaking my heart as it is,
Keep thinking about you
How you used to do those things you do,
The sky used to be blue with a touch of grey,
Now it is black all around all day,
The walls are closing on me,
There’s pain in my heart can’t you see,

Why am I left out in the cold?
With out your warm body to hold,
Now seeing your perfect face,
Is a hard big disgrace,

So why do you feel so happy like about this,
Breaking my heart as it is,
Keep thinking about you
How you used to do those things you do,
The sky used to be blue with a touch of grey,
Now it is black all around all day,
The walls are closing on me,
There’s pain in my heart can’t you see,

The sky used to be blue with a touch of grey,

So why do you feel so happy like about this,
Breaking my heart as it is,
Keep thinking about you
How you used to do those things you do,
The sky used to be blue with a touch of grey,
Now it is black all around all day,
The walls are closing on me,
There’s pain in my heart can’t you see,

The walls are closing in on me,
There is pain inside you can’t see,
Can’t you see?
Can’t you see?

When I wake up in the morning
Your the one who’s on my mind
When we’re not together
I feel I’m left behind
You’re the one I truly love
And who makes me feel so good
The one I can’t stop thinking of
And the one I never would
I see no one else but you
It’s almost like I’m blind
You’re the one I love the most
And you’re always on my mind

I am lonely
in the dark room
because it breaks my heart.
I sit on the chair
and I look in the mirror.
It comes to my mind
so I start feeling.
I close my eyes
and shake my head
and think of myself.
(Thinks)(Signs)(Whispers)
It speaks from my voice.
I opened my eyes
and look straight in the mirror.
In my mind, 
I don’t know if I have a future in this real world, just to survive.
I look around 
and stand up and walk around
in the dark room.
I couldn’t breathe into the air.
I ought to get out of here
in the dark room.
I open the door
and look up at the bright stars.

In the past my love never last
Now I have a love for me that
is so strong and willing to take 
a chance
again together are love spreads
we have effected everyone around us
are love means the world to us
the tenderness,the gentleness
and quite romantic us
that describes us very well
sweet and innocent
pretty much says it all
but then again not everyone
is as innocent after all
are joy of happiness effects
everyone now they can have some fun
baby are love will never end
we will be together forever

You and I equal one.
When you Kiss me, we become one.
When you hold me, we become one.
When you are making love you me, we become one.
When you say "I love you", we become one.
When you know I’m your future, we become one.
When all is said and done, we end each night with a kiss and tight 
embrace as you hold me in your arms all night as if we our one.

Life goes on,
its like a song,
it never stop playing until its gone,
Life goes on,
never give up just be strong,
no matter who says what just hold on,
Life goes on,
love your life no matter what goes wrong,
your family still loves you no matter how much you’ve grown,
Life goes on just keep on playing that song!

I will love you today
I will love you tomorrow
Please don’t break my heart if I give it to
you to borrow
I have had a rough life as you already know
Until I met you it was filled with sorrow
But if we work together you see
We can open the doors to lot’s of possibilities
Together as one is what it will have to be 
Cause you without me I just don’t see 

the land of my people
crying and crying
seeing no help coming 
to see the gongly voices 
all from hills and valleys
crowning from the innocent belly
with many black faces dancing acrobatics
oh my people ...my people
lets pay royalty to our ancestors
now and now till the voice come 

My mind is in a haze,my thoughts are a maze.
My destiny is unknown, not knowing what is to be.
What's going to set me free.
That puts fear deep within side of me.
Darkness wants to fall upon my soul.
Do to me as it wills,no concern on how it feels.
Falling further into this maze of haze.
My life before me seems like nothing but a daze.
Is this something a must go threw,Only if I knew.
Must I bare this darkness within me.
So I can be risen from the shadows and become a new.
To feel joy,life, and laughter,thats what my soul is after.
If this is my destiny, I'm ready to stand and fight.
So I can once again live in the light.
Darkness and despair will be on guard.
This emotional battle will be hard. 
I enter this battle with a strong sense of love.
Giving to me from straight above.

I thought I’d found love
when I met you.
But with time
I am changing my opinion.
Each new day reaffirms
my changing perception.
Each consecutive time I meet you
confirms,
transforms the perception into a fact.
The fact that I love you so much more today,
that what I thought was love on day one,
was sheer mockery.

I love you so much
more everyday
Yesterday, I loved you much more
than a few days before yesterday.
Today my cup is full to the brim.
I am looking forward to tomorrow
and all our tomorrows together.

Only if you knew
How much I loved you 
When you left 
that is when I actually found out how much I loved you.
I would do anything to still be with you
I wanted to be with you forever and just to be there to be by your 
side.
I was happy but now I'm not because I lost the one I loved so much.
If I had to choose right now who I wanted to spend the rest of my life 
with I would choose you. You are the one I loved so much. I didn’t 
know I could love a boy so much until you left 

Do you believe on magic?
that has many logics,
and more on dramatics,
which is full of fantasies.

The magic,
among billions of people around,
God let us meet on the grounds,
and its you I have found,
like music that has rhythm of sounds.

The magic,
I have felt the first time I saw you,
my heart and mind screaming for you,
and my hearts beat I love you,
you and me will be forever do.

The magic,
we felt same feelings and true love,
and I'm so thankful to God above,
that we had this special true love,
this is really magic we’ve got.

Loving one another,
doing things that we love together,
knowing you more better,
I'm looking forward to be with each other.

When we are together,
we will have a lots of laughter,
exploring this mystery world deeper,
struggling magical things higher.

No one can make us apart, never!
even hindrances wont get us bother,
we will fight our love on very eager,
you and I will be great fighter.

My love for you grows more stronger,
holding each others hand as lover,
our love will keep us greater,
and, I will always love you forever.

Sometimes I feel to give up,
this life’s that so tough,
but, seems like I have courage through miles,
when I see your smile.

You came into my life,
sorrows I had was like cut by a knife,
this is such wonderful feeling I had,
its just like you sent from up above.

Since the day I have you,
we’ve been together so true,
one day, I told you that, I love you,
means, forever in my heart, I really do.

When I see you smiling,
oh, you make my heart sing,
when I hear you laughing,
you are really my everything.

Believe in your heart,
Something will happen in your life,
Believe in your hard work,
Something will happen in your life,
Believe in your success,
Something will happen in your life,
Believe in your own power,
Something will happen in your life,
Believe in your true love,
Something will happen in your life,
Believe in your sacrifice,
Something will happen in your life,
Believe in your death,
Something will happen in your life,
Always believe in Miracles,

Have you ever cried because someone you love
told you a lie? The kind of lie you don't need to deny? That makes you 
feel like you just want to die?
All because you know its just another one of there lies?
Then why do you continue to tell me lies? Do you want 
to make me cry, or have my thoughts of you forever known as a big lie?
I'm not here to listen to your lies! I'm here because your the best 
thing thats happened in my life! So now I'm letting you know you don't have 
to lie, because I’ll love you forever even if your not by my side!! 

I love you and I know I do, but then I
think put yourself in his shoes. He got
a lot going on in his life, like the
depression from loosing his wife. Maybe
I'm putting too much on his shoulders,
maybe I'm in his way like a big boulder.
Maybe I'm the one stressing him, maybe I
should leave him alone until he’s ready,
instead of breathing down his neck
steadily. Jamie I know you love me, but
sometimes even though it may be the best
it is hard to set the one you love free.
but I want you to love me, be with me, or
maybe just hold me, that is a way to tell
you really love me. when you don’t talk to
me I feel like I could die,and deep down
inside sometimes I could cry. When you
talk to me I get happy, and no longer feel
so crappy. I love you and that’s all that
matters.

It’s the silence of your Kiss,
It’s the warmth I feel in your touch,
It’s the I love you I hear every morning,
That makes Us mean so much.

It’s the summer breeze,
Upon your face,
To the perfect summer together, 
Filled with love and grace.

It’s as joyful as your first step,
Your first glimpse of snow,
and the feeling you get,
Just before you have accomplished something.

what is "It" You ask?
It is Love,
and that of the wind,
you can’t see it,
but you can feel it,
and the feeling felt once,
Can Last a lifetime.

The tears fell like rain from my eyes, felt as if they would never 
end,
The pain from deep within my heart, feeling as if in two it would be 
rend.
Feeling totally lost and alone, despair soon has become my cruel 
reality,
Life unending must go on for some, while for others death is their 
finality.

One day at a time we must be strong, trying to rebuild our lives and 
move on,
The intense burning pain of our heart, as life goes on will someday be 
foregone.
But the memories we carry until our own time comes, will always 
patiently be there,
We will relive the relationships of our past, and cherish the moments 
we shared.

After our time has come, and our journey through this world has ceased,
Our friends and loved ones, will miss us once we have become deceased.
Then our fond memories they will carry, while traveling on through 
time,
Thinking of our special moments we shared, will leave them feeling 
sublime.
