Falling into deep sleep as my exterior rest while my mind comes out to play.......
I appear in this room with no one around but the walls that surround me.....
I see from a distance a mist that is resting at the base of the door leading into this room...
I hear a knock and I head over to the door and open it..
And its you.......
In your jeans and your t-shirt.......
You hold a smile as you see me......
As I guide you in you keep your eye on me.....
I begin to develop chills......
My heart begins to beat on its on pace.....
Blood begins to flow and you continue to come closer......
I tell you......you don't have to if you don't want too....
Yet you insist and place your finger over my mouth so I don't talk out of being nervous.....
I place my hands on her hips....
As my feelings become true.....
This dream feels real......I don't want to wake up.....
She then places her lips on mine as I begin to continue.....
I then allow myself to become open to this one shared moment.....
As we consistently share kisses and now possible continuation........
You request for my penetration.....to connect us as one.......
Like a magnet to a fridge....I connect.....
You follow with words that sound like another type of language.....
Which makes me feel as if I am doing all the write things.....
Then we end it with a kiss and a, "I don't want this moment to end"
As we part our ways......
My name is Dr. Doofenshmirtz,
in Danville I roam.
I like to tell about myself,
in this little poem.
My nemesis is Perry the Platypus,
also known as Agent P,
I like to tell my evil plans to him,
while he likes to battle with me.
I have many annoyances,
gnomes, nature, and morning talk show hosts,
just to name a few. 
No, I'm not cookoo.
I build my new inators,
with alimony checks I get from my ex-wife.
I know they always end the same, 
but that means I'm so bright.
My brother Roger is the mayor,
I hate him everyday.
Then there is my robot Norm,
who always wants to play.
So before you leave,
I have just one thing to say.
A saying I say everyday.
I Emperor Doofenshmitz,
have to to say to all of us,
hey,
CURSE YOU PERRY THE PLATYPUS!!
How does one describe freedom,
How can one call themselves free,
How does one sleep at night knowing all the troubles that lay ahead,
If one had a choice to be free or have freedom what does one pick,
How does one even begin to describe the choices of being free,
Freedom is choice,
Freedom is happiness,
Freedom is doing what you want,
Freedom is to fly.
I know a foolish and uncaring man,
Who makes his world as empty and sad as he can.
The road that he walks is edged by a wall,
It’s not very wide and not very tall.
Over the wall there are wonderful sights,
Full of beauty, love, passion and lights.
And this foolish man knows it exists,
And he wants to be there but still he resists.
So he hopes he will grow a little more tall,
But won’t bother climbing over the wall.
And he sits to eat food that’s covered in mould,
Maggoty fruit and bread that’s days old.
But all round the table are good things to eat.
Trees laden with fruit and fields of fresh wheat.
But why bother to pick the food that tastes great,
When he’s got the moldy stuff there on a plate.
When a mantle of stars cover the land,
The foolish man stares at the palm of his hand.
His hand is familiar, so he mumbles in sorrow,
One day I’ll look up…maybe tomorrow.
Why crane my neck to look in the air.
I know the stars will always be there.
I am this man, who stares at the wall,
Desperate to climb but scared he might fall.
Who makes second best of whatever he’s got,
And gazes with love at what he has not.
So take my hand and show me what’s there,
Teach me to love, teach me to care.
All that I want
Is to be just like you
To live for the moment
Each day anew
But I am trapped
Lost in the past
Life is but shame
A line that is cast
And still I beware
A future unset
Dreading the day
The maker is met
And so I must flee
Bottle in hand
Drink the last drop
The world becomes grand
And when my head spins
And glass hits the floor
I live for the moment
My cares are no more
Wave goodbye.
Say that it was ok.
Say that it's enough.
Claim that you didn't
find what you came for.
Life is not tangible.
It slips out of your hands
just like the time.
You need time.
You don't need time.
You can't desire something that
vanishes in nothing.
Time is nonexistent.
Life's gone.
You missed your train.
You remained at the station.
And no trains come again.
Nothing stirs.
Death eats up the place.
Few words said, many untold,
Hands held in parting hold,
Much said by teary eye,
Rest by the heavy sigh,
Words weary, at it's threshold.
See the little girl dance and smile,
Twirling away through the aisle,
To be a kid, never weary,
Unburdened by haunting memory,
I wish, if only for  little while.
Lovers, four eyes but one heart,
Fingers entwined, unwilling to depart,
Tough winds carry one afar,
Further away, the closer they are,
It's not an ending, but a fresh start.
There are faces, flushed and bright,
Eager to grow wings, take flight,
Towards strange and new land,
In quest of future, fortune grand,
For isn't change the font of delight?
To rest, my friend, i'll let fears lie,
This moment as memory, never to die
Shall always keep us together,
And should you need a friend, ever,
I'll be waiting, at these gates of goodbye.
True beauty is in the way she laughs
True beauty is in her eyes
True beauty is how she acts
True beauty is inside
True beauty is unseen
True beauty is only felt
True beauty is not mean
True beauty is herself
True beauty can't be cruel
True beauty is bare
True beauty within you
True beauty is always there
True Beauty can't be covered with makeup
True beauty means true love
True beauty can't be baked up
True beauty is the flight of a dove
True beauty has no flaws
For True beauty is all that matters after all
You, you go on ahead
for a while,
I'll let myself led
for a while.
Watch you tread
the dusty paths,
shuffle your feet
in leaves and grass,
wave your arms
as you walk,
prize your charms
as you talk.
You dance with ferns
and smile at birds,
whistle, clap and chant,
as I fall behind.
You, you go on ahead
for a while,
I'll let myself led
for a while.
When your silhouette
Passes out of sight,
I light a cigarette
And I make a right.
They are worlds apart,
but they're tied together
by the thinnest thread,
stretching over oceans,
binding their emotions.
The champion, with his hair in a swirl,
and his angel-winged and holy girl,
and their thread,
as strong as he,
as beautiful as she,
levitating
when of her he thinks,
resonating
when she flaps her wings.
Silver moons belong to them.
And my idiot heart of lead
got tangled in their mighty thread,
and it melted, and it softened,
and got shredded and got blackened.
While looking back upon our lives
Now with hindsight at our strives
Does regret consume our mind?
Or do we leave the pain behind?
Do we leave the pain behind?
The trials and errors of mankind
How possible is perfection?
The aim of natural selection?
Or a concept to drive us more
To do the things that we abhor
To do the things that we abhor
But bodies weaken and minds grow sore
The person inside fades away
Colors dull to white and grey
Who I am turns to who am I?
The youthful soul’s standby
And as the youthful souls standby
All ends with an anguished sigh  
Present turns to past before you even blink
Your life no longer grows instead it merely shrinks
At the end there is one question
No repentance or confession
No judgment or condemnation
No pedestal upon which to sit
Just four words, was it worth it?
I used to have
My senses open wide
On all surrounding
Miracles and small wonders
We used to
Stare at the sky
Moon shining with certainty
And our hearts
Beat faster and faster
In awe of amazement
Now this feelings
Ale slowly perishing
Into empty void
And numb satisfaction
Desire and love
Are succumbed in sea of
Idle sadness
Great fire burns no more
Showing pair of sleepy eyes
Through ashes…
Oak leaf and cowslip and big Brussels sprouts
She's staring and daring and haring about
It's always the same when she takes the kids out
She's fretting and fussing and tutting in doubt
It's fences and hedges that bounce her around
And foxes are noxious and she hates the sound
Of their gut rotting chorus, it sings her to sleep
Then crawls to the corner to quietly weep
Please don't be deceived by the devil soft eyes
They're just her most recent and subtle disguise
She's leaf shielded, blade wielding, living revenge
Don't hound her
Don't touch her
The sun is dead, the sun is dead
And each dawn sheds a mist of tears
Upon the field where he last bled
The chill of grief condenses here
The winter wakes to frost that scars
The folded flower of my heart
My sons, my few, I'll cry for you
A film of dew upon the grass
A boy turning into a man its a scary thing worrying about things you never even cared about.
girls...
money...
cars ... and
kids...
its a scary thing when these lil boys turns into a man and only become worse looking down at his own son.
I can only stand here and pray for him a better road for him.
he needs his education that I never gave myself a chance to have.
he needs a better background that I I will brake my back for him to have.
these lil kid only understand what daddy can give but one day he will under the pain and blood that was shed for him to be the man that he is today.
I thought I saw her face today In the sparkle of the morning sun.
And then I heard the angel say Her work on earth is done
I thought I heard her voice today Then laugh her wonderful laugh.
And then I heard the angel says there's peace little one at last
I thought I felt her touch today In the breeze that rustled by.
And then I heard the angel says The spirit never dies
I thought that she had left us For the stars so far above.
And then I heard the angel say She left us with her love 
I thought that I would miss her And never find my way.
And then I heard the angel say She is with you every day
these is building inside.
these is tearing me up lil at a time.
the anger is controlling.
the poetry is helping me to calm down and breath once more.
only if I could go back and tell my self of these therapy.
these is slowly passing away.
but the therapy can only hold so long.
the anger is controlling but only when I've lost control.
The eyes of an angel
were shown to me today
Chills ran down my arms
Not knowing what to say
Behind those beautiful eyes
Lies the most lovely soul
So warm and so passionate
But not everyone knows
She made me feel special
Sweetly leading me inside
A place were our souls meet
Hearts open as we confide
Modestly she doesn't know
My heart she has stolen
Makes me soar when I'm down
Warms me when I am frozen
Those eyes shine brightly
Brilliant light in dark skies
I sit and stare motionless
In her sweet angel eyes
Life’s been changing
And Love’s not lost
I’m for rearranging
No matter the cost
I’ve always been a downer
That’s just who I am
But when I’m around her
I feel alive again
Love has hurt me before
But John Donne was only half-right
If you give enough, Love will give more
Love has the power, Love has the might
She walks in beauty
From Heaven she fell
She sees right through me
Without her it’s Hell
You may call me sappy
Or confused if you must
But in the end I’ll be happy
In the end, Love is just
Left....Left....Left....Right......Left.......
Are my feet that matches my heart beat when it comes to you.........
As corny as it may sound you are the water to my stew.....
Or the hopper to my brew.....
I cant help to notice how much I have served you
And yet I love every part of it......
Truth......
I don't mind walking you where the others wont
Just so you could know that no matter where we go I am support for you.
Just like the backbone of me and the ribs of you
I inhale the thought and feeling of us
My boys make fun of me but only because they don't have our understanding
As they continue their search for someone like you....
I have the last laugh when we lay in this bed
And I make love to you........
Dolls to a voodoo or a religion to its preacher
I am interested in you......
Pushing away the things aside and wanting to step toward what is to come to us two......
The sun still sleeps
as the forest weeps
as the mist of the morning falls
whilst beast and creature crawls
my bed lay abandoned
the furnace untended
my boots slide on my feet
and yet the sun still sleeps
into the vast wild's space
quiver strung loose at my waist
in my hand my bow I keep
and yet the sun still sleeps
to the hills, I take myself
as some, auld mystic elf
over the rise a nice, plump doe
I creep, I crawl and knock my bow
yet with the blessing of Artemis
I let loose my sliver of death
I bear the heavy hearted elation
and set my destination
I see there my prize
where she fell, and will not rise
this creature will never again creep
and yet the sun, still doth sleep
I stand here alone with you,
With deepest desire,
With hurt and with pain,
For I know, Our love is forbidden.
You look into my eyes,
I see boundaries in the reflections,
Oh, how can this be possible?
I've know love, but not like this,
Touch me now and end this sorrow,
Embrace! Let me be one with you?
Let the sunshine die and let the night be ours forever,
Let the stars be our comfort and the earth be our bed,
Let tomorrow be another day,
For now, my love, let me have this moment,
Let time stand still and let no other sound be made,
So our heart's beat as one, and our feelings be plain,
Let us love each other again.
There's a darkness in the hallway
A cold, cold silence Hangs about
Now that the final candle
Has flickered and died out.
The wind without the four walls
Turns its whisper to a weep
But neither wind nor rain can enter
Where all the sisters sleep.
Out across the moorlands
The winter's packed and gone
And springtime reigns majestic
With the first new lambs now born.
But the sisters they see nothing
There's a darkness in their eyes
Imprisoned thus forever
Nor door nor window to the skies.
Time has passed and proven
Each one equal to any man
So we treasure the web long since woven
By Charlotte, Emily and Anne.
Dawn chorus, I have woken to turn off the player,
Last night it was stopped not by chance,
The screen is the picture,
A beauty, brown skin and blue eyes,
With whom I sometimes may agree,
Love hurts,
Near me is my lassie, my girlie,
With the marvelous features,
Chocolate skin, azure eyes,
We are like cappuccino,
Clasping our dark and white hands.
The breakfast, I scan a newspaper,
Astonished, robotically say my surprise,
Instinctively, movement, why not to consider,
I speak to her wonderful eyes,
‘You know…  Mark Twain, the Finn’s story,
It’s classic… it’s silly if anything changed’…
She stops for a second,
‘I don’t know … please… let’s on anything else,’
Then quickens and advances a hip film,
We’ll be like cappuccino,
Clasping our dark and white hands.  
The evening, I drive, a jammed traffic,
The cell-phone, I’ve missed it at work,
I head for the movies,
As near as late I am dashing in foyer,
And see the forlorn azure glance,
With little tear-drops,
‘What’s happened?’
She convincingly presses herself against me,
And in low she speaks,
‘My darling, my sweet white racist,
I thought that you’d never appear near your brown lassie,’
Why, darling… oh, I get it,
We are like cappuccino,
Clasping our dark and white hands!  
The ghosts in the hall were beckoned by fear. 
The children’s dreams, silent as they watched with care. 
Silently they crept, with an occasional creak
as their weightless step echoed within the old wooden suite.
 
Moment by moment, they drew ever closer
Apparitions stalking, hunting with hunger. 
Slowly and loudly, the door opened wide
Vapors and smiles creeping inside. 
 
A child who was far from slumber
Watched with wide eyes and tried to mutter.
The others were beckoned by the look on his face
cowering in corners as they stalked without a trace. 
 
Within moments the suite was filled with screams
the dark room painted with a sinister scene
Blood was smeared, on their unseen lips
Eerie grins from their pleasure trip.
I thought I knew.......
I thought I knew that I would have a hard time getting over you.....
I guess I learning something new each day.....
Separating my heart from this page....
I would be walking in a daze.....
Guided through this maze with the sent of confusion....
Maybe this may be my souls illusion in this dilemma of mine.
I risk every time I cross paths with the opposite attractive kind.....
No need to rewind because my memories are just fine.....
Replaying in my head like an old cassette tape,
Yet I cant erase the time I seen you....
I do everything right but do one thing wrong that towers over all my actions....
No I have never cheated and nor do I believe in such a thing,
I am old fashion soul that is open to what the world brings.....
But not this heart ache....
That I absorb through my pours in these days of misunderstanding.
All I want is someone of my type that I believe I deserve....
I wish it was her......
Only her that would make me smile daily.......
Do you remember that sunny day?
It was early spring, in that little street
I rambled along and watched the windows
and the colorful textiles in that shop...
I turned in and my fingers played on those
many fine fabrics, the dust was floating in the air --
I saw it clearly in the sunlight, in the beams,
and out there in the street I took a deep breath
when I stepped out again into the freshness.
And we knew that you'll be here...
Something drew you near.
Sunshine whispered in your ear...
Just so you know I think about you sometimes.
 Sometimes I cry.  Other times I yell at the pictures of you. Sometimes I yell at myself for crying about you. 
Sometimes I curl up in my bed and pretend that you’re holding me.  Sometimes I punch my pillow pretending it’s your face.  
Sometimes I walk with the independence knowing that I don’t need you.  Sometimes it hurts so much I can’t stand.
Sometimes I look in the mirror and see beauty that you took for granted.  Sometimes I look in the mirror and get lost in the sadness in my eyes.
Sometimes I walk and daydream about the life we could have had together.  Sometimes I wish I had never met you.
Sometimes I let my girlfriends hold me and tell me I don’t deserve this.  Sometimes I can tell myself.
Sometimes I fall into another man’s arms.  Sometimes I fall in love with you all over again.
Sometimes I smile about the good times.  Sometimes I die on the inside when I simply remember your smile.
Sometimes I listen to our song and sing along.  Sometimes I can’t get out the words in-between sobs.
Sometimes I look at you and wonder why you didn’t treat me right.  Sometimes I just look at you, wishing you would take the time to treat me in any way you wanted as long as you looked back at me.
Sometimes I wonder if you ever think about me too. 
Life, it full of all sorta  pain
It ones big game
Different but always the same
Don’t try to control it
Just take the hits and roll with it
Filled with this love and this hate
 Don’t be Afraid to leave the starting gate
Never Try too hard, take a step back, disengage
There is just some things you learn with age
Learn to live with sorrow
Bite your lip and pray for tomorrow
It’s not always pretty
When you get down to the nitty gritty
Gotta know you’re not always in control
Seems like god always favor an asshole
There is one thing you need to get
So you’re not stuck with regret
Life will just be selfless
Till you realize you’re helpless
And that
What doesn’t kill you makes your stronger
Dig deep you can last a little longer
You’re going to get pushed and shoved
Going to get kicked and loved
Filled with terror, by those who pretend to care
Don’t rush those that try to conceal
Don’t make an ordeal
Just wait till they reveal
What you get is all real
Nothing left to peel
Just listen to what your feel
And even if you feel that your done
With pressure that weighs a ton
You will make it in the long run
Remembering you are my number one
Never be afraid to cry
It is apologizing to the 1 in the sky
It is simply just a tear
It doesn’t show any fear
It doesn’t mean you are weak
Doesn’t mean you’re a freak
So Come cry in my arm
In here you are safe from harm
I am the barrier for the hate
Come on in you know I can relate
Let your tears be acid rain
It’s alright you don’t have to explain
I know the tears destroy the wall of sorrow
Just take my hand and follow
I want you to know what I’d do for you
With me just imagine what you can get through
I’ll make your pain my pain
And I won’t complain
If your tears make a stain
Because imagining life without you makes me insane
My heart is always changing
Broken and Ripped
Rearranged and Exchanged
Torn and chipped
By people who judge and hate
So I guard my bleeding heart
And I lock it up behind a gate
As it gets torn apart
But I never feel a threat
With my heart in your hands
I cannot fret
Its locked on tight with loving bands
I always know you will be there
With your healing words that work like glue
I can no longer see a rip or tear
When my heart is being guarded by you
You go past the outer shell of my heart
Dive deep into unknown lands
Reshape it into a work of art
Because you are the one that understands
When It is open for you I feel love and Grace
I don’t worry about my pride or my place
I forget all about the scars of hate
Because I am surrounded by this feeling you create
It’s  that time of the season
I always feel alone
To be unhappy is treason
But I like to moan
Christmas is never fun
Christmas is always sad
And I’ve got a feeling
I want to be so bad
So go down that alcohol
Kiss the forbidden girl
This year won’t be dull
This year won’t be dull
Christmas is never fun
Christmas is always hell
And I’ve got a dodgy feeling
This one will be boring as well
It’s that time of the season
The TV is blank
And I’ve got a reason
To be a total crank
Christmas is never fun
Christmas is always sad
And I’ve got a feeling
I want to be so bad
So go down that alcohol
Kiss the forbidden girl
This year won’t be dull
This year won’t be dull
Christmas is never fun
Christmas is always hell
And I’ve got a dodgy feeling
This one will be boring as well
It’s that time of season
The turkey is dry
Yuletide is a lesion
Upon my tired eyes 
Christmas is never fun
Christmas is always sad
And I’ve got a feeling
I want to be so bad
So go down that alcohol
Kiss the forbidden girl
This year won’t be dull
This year won’t be dull
Christmas is never fun
Christmas is always hell
And I’ve got a dodgy feeling
This one will be boring as well
Everybody Likes My Clock
It doesn’t tick and it doesn’t tock
Its’ digital hi-tech stuff
It tries it’s best to spread some love
Everybody likes my clock
Every day I change the font
Darker lines, squiggly bits
Sometimes it’s great, sometimes it’s shit
Everybody likes my clock
It’s always there, that’s not shock
It’s become a big part of me
Reminds me of my mortality
Time, time, precious time
Won’t you make all of it mine?
To do with it as I please
To put the leaves back on the trees
Everybody likes my clock
It turned Dylan from folk to rock
It’s influence is all around
Still it doesn’t make a sound
Down by the coffee machine, Caroline’s there
With her moles and her mousy hair
Her bouncing chest and her sparkling eyes
Her wicked smile that cuts through my lies
I try my hardest not to leer
But it’s difficult when someone’s as intriguing as her
I nearly fell
I nearly fell
I nearly fell
Gayle sat next to me today
No work, no rest, only play
Not much to do around here
You’ve got to have a laugh when someone pretty is sat near
I notice her forehead and her long flowing hair
I am scared that I’m beginning to care
I nearly fell
I nearly fell
I nearly fell
I’ve found I’m lying in Anna’s bed
I wonder what’s going on in her head
Does she really want me here?
Does she, in any way, consider me dear?
I think I’ll leave, I know I should
I got up and went as quick as I could
I nearly fell
I nearly fell
I nearly fell
15 months and one begins to feel better. 
Something new has come along, something beautiful.
Something one wishes to help them forget the past.
You hold on, and close your eyes, embracing a new life.
Yet, the past is burned into the eyelids, and the memories flood back.
Do I really want to forget what once was...?
Am I truly happy...?
15 months and one thinks they begin to fell better.... 
My leaves are falling
Dying
My branches are bare
I crave the sunshine
The blooms
But I grasp nothing but air. 
Now I must lay my demons to rest,
no longer can I deny my own guilt.
This sorrow that tears my soul apart,
seeps in from a world I helped to build.
Deceit, treachery and cowardly lies,
weren't just actions of others,
they were also mine.
Now scars self inflicted I carry with me,
scars I know will never fade away.
With a remorseless mind I took what I liked,
in the devils playground I chose to play.
With my decadence, weakness and senseless hate,
I do nothing,
nothing except for seal my own fate.
I rise from this dark tomb in which I laid myself to rest,
I can feel myself coming back to life.
I see the path I feel I must follow,
and now I have the strength to do what I know is right.
Although its down this path I have chosen,
it is in the good deeds I do, I know I will pay my price.
I'll take the shit I have dealt,
my punishment, I know I must.
Because of my actions,
the rewards I receive will be clouded with distrust.
The demons I'll banish,
but the scars will stay,
to remind me,
I must never turn back to my old ways.
A magic moment I remember, I looked
up and saw you standing there.
An Angelic vision and living proof
of all that are beautiful and rare.
My breath was completely taken from me,
goings on around me I did not care.
For I was totally spellbound by you, all
I could do was stand there and stare.
As I stood there agape and stared at you,
with so much noise and activity around.
All I heard was silence, my heartbeat
being the only audible sound.
Who was this beauty so elegant and
graceful moving across the floor?
And how could something so wonderful 
exist without me ever seeing her before?
So many emotions washed over me that day,
I didn't understand but I would soon see.
From that very moment I saw my soul mate,
I knew every thing you*d ever mean to me.
For that day I learned how love felt, and
from that day on I would love and adore.
That vision who was shopping with her mother
and sister in our home town grocery store.
My sister was my life.
She’s with God now and looks down.
Wondering if I will ever stand my ground.
Stop worrying, she says out loud.
Take care of your family, take care of you.
Love yourself and things will come thru.
Live life full and you will see.
That one day your life will change and you
Will be happy.
Believe in our Father.
For He knows what you need.
Believe me sis, you will succeed.
So my darling sis, look up in the sky.
Remember one day your soul will fly.
We will be together you will see.
Please be happy and take care of your family.
With all my love from me to you.
Kiss mom and dad and all the kids too.
Goodnight my sis; please be strong.
Just remember you’re never alone.
One last time I say goodbye and please, my sis never cry.
I’m here for you night and day.
God bless you sis; now its time to pray.
Thank you for thy love
that gave my life a start,
For thy gentle touch
that gave my life a start.
Thank you for thy hands
where my hope lies in,
For thy shoulder of comfort
where I could always lean.
With my deepest love & affection
I wrote this poem to thee,
So that you might know
how much you mean to me.  
Precious Lord Take My Hand
Lead me Lord to the right man
My heart is broke. My mind is weak 
And my body is worn. Through the Mr. Right knows and in spite of the fun. 
I'm still Lord without no one
So Lord hear my cry hear my pleas
Send that Sexy Man Of God (SMOG) to me.
And when he comes Lord let me know
Let him come right through my door.
Hands out and heart filled with love
And stamped: "Straight From Heaven Above"
Signed, Sealed, Delivered!!!! 
Love comes from above,
in the heart from the start,
once you love someone,
you never for get them.
It gets faster and faster,
and then one day you say something,
so they try to forget you.
But you can*t erase all the words you say,
so you have to go another way,
then one day you meet a new true love.
Your heart solars above like a dove,
in the sky way up high,
it takes off with a leaping jump,
and my heart goes thumpity, thump, thump.
I jump around when I see your smile,
when we are together for a while.   
“The most precious thing”, 
and so we say…
though why do millions die,
everyday?
From murders to rapists, 
from guns to knives,
we hurt each other
and destroy their lives.
Wars and disputes, 
weapons and graves, 
we say we want to help,
though we live in our caves.
If we wish to live life,
we must do our part,
we must look deep within,
into our heart.
Life was a gift,
we must live it to the best
we must enjoy our time,
the time we have left…..
Life was a word,
a word that meant joy,
is there life anymore?
for any girl or boy…  
When your growing up you should keep this in mind,
When it comes to boys don’t always be kind.
A one-night stand is the worst thing to do,
Because more often then not, they wont respect you.
Do not get wasted and go to the club,
You’ll act like a fool when you’re drunk at a pub.
It’s not a good thing when you have too much to drink,
Bad things can happen because you don’t often think.
You could be having the greatest night,
But one wrong move and your into a fight.
Flashbacks the next day will make you shame,
You’ll hang your head low with no one to blame.
When you’re drunk you act foolish, and you simply wont care,
But what you remember tomorrow, is the hardest to bare.
You’ll stager in front of people and sometimes fall to the ground,
And before you know it no one wants you around.
But you’ll go out and get drunk again and again,
You’ll look like a tart, and act just the same.
Guys will try to take advantage of you,
Stupidly thinking its okay because you’re blue.
You can have fun, talk to people and smile,
When you’re well behaved, it makes last night worthwhile.
Know when you’ve had enough and quit while your ahead,
Have a good feed and then go home to bed.
People will think you’re a drunk, and a hopeless case,
Don’t make that mistake and drink at a pace.
Have respect for yourself and always take care,
Because tomorrows hangover is the hardest to bare. 
Someone asked me today "Why do You love him so?"	
And I said. I love him for the smile he gives me and 
the way he gazes into my eyes with that crocked little smile.	
That's why I Love him so.	
I love him for the pride he taught me to stand up for my 
beliefs, and if I ever had to do it again I would say Yes 
a thousand times.	
I love him for the little jokes he cracks to make me laugh
Because before he is happy or comfortable he makes sure I am too.
I love him for him just as he loves me for me.
I love you for who you are and you are the Love of my Life. You can 
not change your
life, but you can change the way it's lived. I am your wife and that 
I'm glad to be.
Not a sole on this earth can change the way I feel about you and me.
The way I feel for you is beyond words
The way I feel when I'm around you is hard to explain
My voice lowers, my heart speeds
yet you cause me so much pain
Sometimes I dream about you and wish you were
mine
My love growing stronger and stronger with time
You put me down but I still want you
You turn me away but I need you
You hurt me with your words, but why?
You tear my heart to shreds but I refuse to die
I try to break away, but my mind says no
My friends tell me to follow my heart
But how can I do this when you've tore it apart
I'm confused
Should I stay, Should I go?
I like you and I don't know why
Wether it's your smile or the way you walk
Something about you makes me melt inside
Every time I hear your voice my heart stops beating
Yet you spit in my face and turn me away like I*m not worth keeping
The way I feel for you, can*t be explained
But yet you treat me like dirt, call me out my name
When we're alone I see a spark in your eyes
But when your with your boys that spark dwindles and dies
You say nothing good about me, everything you
say is a lie
That's when I knew I had to tell you goodbye
You don't even care how I feel
The hurt you cause within, no I'm not gonna cry, I'm not gonna shed a 
tear for are love has gone and you have made that real clear
but yet I have love for you, why? I don't know
But, it's more love than I can bear
My heart still wants to love you, but It's afraid of what you might 
do
The pain you might cause
I still have love for you, I always will
But I'm gonna let you go
I have to
But you will forever be my first, nobody above
Forever in my heart, you were my First Love
You are always in my thoughts 
Day and night, here and there
You are always in my dream
When I visibly sleep
Your Image never fades in my heart
Even when you are gone
The scent of you 
Still in my palms
The pleasant words you say
Still in my memory
When we are apart like this 
Life is not fair enough
I know you are only gone for a while and will back in a short while
But ahead of that, know that I truly care
And missing you thoughtfully 
It was a dark and stormy night,
The air was still, and full of fright,
off in the distance I could see,
a dark figure moving, getting closer to me,
then I realized my time was done,
it was the grim reaper, he had won.
Now that my time on earth is through,
I guess I have nothing else to do.
Just remember the things in the past,
because life was never meant to last.
So live each day as if it were through,
this way you will never leave anything, left to do.
A wail of thunder,
Echo’s through the dark shanty village,
The sound of whispers,
Hums like a lullaby,
Beneath this atmosphere,
A new life is brought down to earth,
The tears of the mother,
The pride of the father,
Foresees his future
Wrapped in white; he’s brought out,
Only to recognize his meaningless future,
Future of poverty,
Future of tears,
Only to be lived by those without fear,
Stumbling and tumbling he grows up,
Only to befriend sorrows and tears,
No love shown on him,
No happiness booned to him,
Hardship was his life,
POVERTY was his name.
I hear a car door slam.
As I lie awake in bed.
I know now that you’re hear.
A single tear is shed.
I sense what will occur,
When you stumble through the door.
You’ll take it out on her,
Then leave her shattered on the floor.
She’ll pick herself back up again,
Then come into my room.
And tell me that she can sustain.
All your binding doom.
But I know it’s not the truth,
She’s slowly dying inside.
You’re taking away her youth,
While she swallows all her pride.
I know she thinks of running away,
But she realizes it’s no use.
There will be a price to pay,
And it will end in more abuse.
No, this poem does not rhyme;
it isn't meant to,
for this poem speaks of truth
as it speaks of love.
Many people try to picture love;
what it looks like,
what it feels like,
and if he/she will ever find it.
but the truth is-
you really don't have to look for it.
you've already found it.
You've had it since the day you were born,
most people just think they don't have it
but only because they have too much of it;
As us humans do have a tendency to ignore what we already have,
take it for granted-
nay, throw it all away
because we are, as so, consumed by greed, as even myself.
I suppose you want to know what love really looks like?
What love really feels like?
And if you will ever find it?
Well, when these questions find themselves swimming in your thoughts,
just remember you already have it.
God gave us love to give it.
He gave us feeling so that when it is given to us, we may receive it,
so that we may enjoy it.
He gave it to us,
so that we may not waste away searching for it, and we could spend our 
lives using the gifts he gave us.
Now, the only question left, is whether you are going to choose to 
continue to ignore it, spend your entire life, the one true gift God gave 
you, searching for what you already possess- 
or whether you are going to finally stop throwing it away and start 
anew, see God and the truth of true love, and start doing what you were 
intended to do-
Start giving the love you were given.
I'm so sorry for hurting you but it was the least I could do
Our friends were telling lies that made us not want to look in to each 
others eyes...
Now I ask just take me back so we can relive our loving past...
My love for you will never end...
Its not over between the bend in our hearts...
So I ask today take me back...for I am not a hack...
I am the one who loves you with all my heart...
The one who will write you an e-mail once a day to show you how much I 
love you...
So take me back so I can live another day cause without you I'm not 
ok...
I have no meaning without you in my life...
It seems pointless to go another day...
But I know that there is always that one chance you will take me 
back...
So my heart doesn't move on...
Because I no my love will win you back
A friend is there when you’re feeling down
To give you a smile
When you’re wearing a frown
A friend is there to guide you through
All the tests
You thought you knew
A friend is there to take you along
And tell you that
You can go on
A friend is one whom you can depend
That will be there
Until the very end
A friend is there to release your fear
A friend is somehow always near
Oh! How beautiful it is to sit in the Garden;
It is so fascinating to watch the trees dancing with soft and cool 
breath 
Of the winter wind;
And it is relaxing to listen to the soft music of the water falls 
and the sweet voices of the birds;
And it*s so wonderful to gaze at the mysterious beauty of the sky;
Oh! I feel good resting in the Garden 
As I am surrounded with green plants and trees;
But, how I wish that I would see lots of flowers with variety of colors 
and scents
until the next time I would visit the Garden;
After each day of my work, in this beautiful weather, I am looking 
forward 
To sit and observe the beauty and cleanliness of the Garden
As it makes me calm, comfortable and it meditates my soul.
Oh, this day is finally through.
The only thing I want to do,
Is crawl into bed and wallow.
Hoping sleep is soon to follow.
But thoughts begin to filter in.
They seem so fickle to begin.
Errands needing to be run.
Pay this now and that needs done.
I feel myself drifting off,
But interrupted with a cough.
Just enough to open up the door.
Setting off the thoughts once more.
I can’t help the tossing and the turning
Peaceful thoughts is what I’m yearning.
Slumber’s avoiding me it seems.
Losing hope of soothing dreams.
I look at the clock in fright.
Wishing I could end my plight.
These thoughts are not concluding.
Why is sleep so eluding?
The clock is now showing three.
Please worries won’t you let me be.
Glancing at the clock I sigh.
Feeling myself want to cry.
Those hours flew by way too fast.
Slumber’s finding me at last.
Just a few hours till I wake.
But that’s all I get to take.
The moment arriving that I dread.
I have to get up and out of bed.
Even though the hours were few,
I have a lot of things to do.
Oh, this day is finally through.
The only thing I want to do,
Is crawl into bed and wallow.
Hoping sleep is soon to follow.
So, there you were...
a figure of resonant vibrations,
whispering hymns replete with passion,
like a phoenix heralded by the tides,
relentlessly flying through the skies.
And there I was...
a searching shadow at sundown,
a sojourner on a forlorn mound,
streamlined with fallible innocence,
yielding with resisting acquiescence.
Then Cupid struck my heart...
Oh! My heart liquified with fervor,
oblivious to other people’s rancor,
forbearing the torments of reality,
I was swept with a love fantasy.
A realization suddenly rocked my core,
staggering my brains out and shaking my soul,
as pang vanquishes all that’s left in me,
captivating my dreams into a vain reality.
Then my spirit languished
and my body, lifeless of a broken heart;
I realized your love was never mine 
right from the very start.
I’ve dwelt in torment`
Self-inflicted & karma driven,
Not quiet in my lament`
Warning you from the beginning;
Of the totality`
In my dysfunction,
Fortified reality`
You see no illusion;
Yet now chaotic`
It surrounds us,
And becomes hypnotic`
No controlling this;
Your change in mind`
My heart in ruins,
Your strength now blind`
No longer fluent;
Holding fast`
But losing ground,
Once meant to last`
Now falling down !
Leaves has fallen from the trees
Just like those of my captured dreams
Strong wind keeps on crushing me down
Baffled by a voice whispering so loud
Flowers were destroyed by the stranger
Now miracles were placed more farther
Fragrance poisoned my vision
Cursed with a life that will never go on
The sun lightens up the whole sky
Telling me when’s the right time
Dark clouds keep oneself back
Precluding chances that lived through others luck
A garden full of glittering treasures
Dreams surrounded by blunders so pure
Only shattered reveries grow in this place
And peace can never be displayed.
I got up today I was thinking of you
The day we walked down the aisle to say our I do’s 
Water was falling but not from our eyes 
One single drop fell from the sky
God was showing us things could be tough
Life is not easy and things can get rough 
Days will be happy and days will sad 
We will love each other and sometimes get mad
Sometimes were together sometimes were apart 
When I am alone you’re in my heart
We had two kids that took most our time 
When we get older things will be fine
I see us sitting under a tree still deeply in love 
Cause God sent you to me from above 
My heart bleeds for the hungry children who’ve been dying
The hopeless mothers who’ve been crying
Thy guy who got killed by his blood brother
The kids with no shelter in the hot and cold weather
The people who got robed in broad day light
The little girls who got raped day and night
The father who watched and put up no fight
The never knowing what’s next meal kids
The forever ill kids
The old man who got caught up in the war
My heart bleeds for you sir
My heart bleeds for you
My heart bleeds for the mother who’s been terrorized
The mother who’s been paralyzed
The mother who couldn’t provide for her own kids
The mother who taught us to do good deeds
The mother who raised the good children and the bad
The mother who showered with her children’s blood
The mother who was once very happy but now sad
The mother who became blind from crying daily
The mother who was always friendly 
The mother who’s also known as somalia
My heart bleeds for you mama mia
My heart bleeds for you
We’d be sad because someone would die
Or we can be happy because a friend just became a bride.
Time Show’s its age
Like a bird in a Cage.
We are stuck in a lifetime
such as when a person is put in jail by doing a crime.
Time can put us in our place
A king could just be sitting in a room
and next he would be dead in a tomb
when we meet a new person in high school we can say hi,
but right at graduation we have to say goodbye.
In a dark room we’d be overcome with fright
and wake up with a bright light.
Is it really love? 
or is it just a passing feeling
am I not convinced?
a bit uncertain of the feeling
Is it the way you make me feel?
so warm with joy and laughter
or could it be the happiness
from moments spent together
The lasting bliss, the kiss I miss,
The sweetest thoughts without a touch
The heart that hurts and bears a scar
thinking how far away you are
You’re on my mind most of the day
And at night I go to bed and pray
An angel soft and gentle as you
Would make my sweetest dreams come true
Thinking about you alone or in class
Writing your name on my bathroom window glass
Wishing you were here
To love hold and care
Wishing I had you with me
To cherish and to stare
Into your soft and beautiful eyes
As we both travel to the skies
And mingle with the stars above
But is it really love?
You know the feeling, 
when you see that one girl you really like. But yet, 
you see a man holding her hand,
and kissing her lips, 
and holding her waist. 
And ALL you can do is think. 
Think of the things you’d do for her,
think of the things that the future may hold. 
And all you feel, 
is your heart dropping to the floor,
all you feel is getting goosebumps going up and down your spine. 
And all you can do. 
Is talk All you can do is wait, and see. And in the end, it ends up 
being another man, same story. 
This poem could never amount to be
The love and courage you once gave to me.
I cannot even begin to say 
The happiness you caused to me that one glorious day.
This new restored hope,
A resurrection within,
A new beautiful story is about to begin.
Your presence is soothing,
Your touch is caress.
This new learned yearning for nothing more, nothing less.
Your touch says you’ll hold me, guard me, 
and always stay by my side,
So there is where I’ll want to reside
Your laugh is contagious, as is you charming smile,
I could think of you and easily run - more than sixty miles.
I want to thank you for letting me be,
Myself when I’m around you, 
Nobody, but me.
I have built a great wall around my sore heart,
And you took it down, and tore it apart.
Somehow you got through, you got through to me,
Oh, how lovely the chorus of sweet jubilee.
I think about you every time,
I think about you all the time.
I wish this haunting would go away,
unless this love was returned.
This love that keeps loving,
with nothing, but yearning,
a yearning to be yearned, 
to be missed loved,
and adored.
I want to be wanted,
like I do for you.
I wish to know of your feelings,
’cause I haven’t a clue. 
Do you think about me every time,
all the time?
Do you go crazy wanting to know?
Are you a hopeless wreck that needs to be needed?
Do you wish to scream out and let that whole world know?
Do your days fly by without your knowing?
Does your mind go astray thinking of me?
Do you have this same feeling that doesn’t seem to stop growing?
Do you ever have urges of wanting to know?
Do you feel for me,
the way I feel for you?
Adoption is Love
Adoption is a gift from above
It’s better than all things
Love comes to you with fast wings
Adoption is never done!
Adoption is more than fun
It’s sweeter than candy
it may even come in handy.
If you’re adopted, and don’t like it at all
Consider you’re blessed, because it’s the greatest gift of all.
Sometimes I feel
That I hate the man
Who helped me bring
Kids to this land
He cheated on me
With my best friend
And said he still loved me
But wanted us to end
He spent three years
Trying to find out
If he was to stay
With her or without
He left me with two
Kids to care for
And felt that the family
Life was a bore
Now he is
To spend the eternity
Feeling with guilt
And without purity
The kids and I
Are now the happiest
In walked a man
Who is the manliest
He watches over
The kids and me
Without any regrets
And full of glee
I now am happy
But can’t say the same
For the man who walked out
Without no shame
For him and his girlfriend
I thank them for all
They both took the old me
And made me fall
But now I’m the strongest
In body and soul
For now my heart
Is brought back to whole
So now I’m done
Telling the story
That led me to life
Full of glory
What was she to do when you went away? 
Sit on her bed and just sing? 
Nothing but you was on her mind every day
every time she looked on her finger that had no ring.
She gave you her heart
and you pushed it around
She should have known better right from the start.
you just took her heart and slammed it on the ground.
I'm going out and get something.
I don't know what.
I don't care.
Whatever's out there, I'm going to get it.
Look in those shop windows at boxes
and boxes of Reeboks and Nikes
to make me fly through the air
like Michael Jordan
like Magic.
While I'm up there, I see Spike Lee.
Looks like he's flying too
straight through the glass
that separates me
from the virtual reality
I watch everyday on TV.
I know the difference between
what it is and what it isn't.
Just because I can't touch it
doesn't mean it isn't real.
All I have to do is smash the screen,
reach in and take what I want.
Break out of prison.
South Central homey's newly risen
from the night of living dead,
but this time he lives,
he gets to give the zombies
a taste of their own medicine.
Open wide and let me in,
or else I'll set your world on fire,
but you pretend that you don't hear.
You haven't heard the word is coming down
like the hammer of the gun
of this black son, locked out of this big house,
while massa looks out the window and sees only smoke.
Massa doesn't see anything else,
not because he can't,
but because he won't.
He'd rather hear me talking about mo' money,
mo' honeys and gold chains
and see me carrying my favorite things
from looted stores
than admit that underneath my Raider's cap,
the aftermath is staring back
unblinking through the camera's lens,
courtesy of CNN,
my arms loaded with boxes of shoes
that I will sell at the swap meet
to make a few cents on the declining dollar.
And if I destroy myself
and my neighborhood
&quot;ain't nobody's business, if I do,&quot;
but the police are knocking hard
at my door
and before I can open it, 
they break it down
and drag me in the yard. 
They take me in to be processed and charged, 
to await trial,
while Americans forget
the day the wealth finally trickled down
to the rest of us.
You keep me waiting in a truck 
with its one good wheel stuck in the ditch, 
while you piss against the south side of a tree. 
Hurry. I've got nothing on under my skirt tonight. 
That still excites you, but this pickup has no windows 
and the seat, one fake leather thigh, 
pressed close to mine is cold. 
I'm the same size, shape, make as twenty years ago, 
but get inside me, start the engine; 
you'll have the strength, the will to move. 
I'll pull, you push, we'll tear each other in half. 
Come on, baby, lay me down on my back. 
Pretend you don't owe me a thing 
and maybe we'll roll out of here, 
leaving the past stacked up behind us; 
old newspapers nobody's ever got to read again. 
You are not beautiful, exactly.
You are beautiful, inexactly.
You let a weed grow by the mulberry
And a mulberry grow by the house.
So close, in the personal quiet
Of a windy night, it brushes the wall
And sweeps away the day till we sleep.
A child said it, and it seemed true:
"Things that are lost are all equal."
But it isn't true. If I lost you,
The air wouldn't move, nor the tree grow.
Someone would pull the weed, my flower.
The quiet wouldn't be yours. If I lost you,
I'd have to ask the grass to let me sleep.
I don't know what you think you're doing,
sweeping the ground. You
do it so easily, backhanded, forehanded.
You hardly bend. Really, you sway.
What can it mean
when a thing is so easy?
I threw dirt on my father's floor.
Not dirt, but a chopped green
dirt which picked up dirt.
I pushed the push broom.
I oiled the wooden floor of the store.
He bent over and lifted the coal
into the coal stove. With the back of the shovel
he came down on the rat just topping the bin
and into the fire.
What do you think?—Did he sway?
Did he kiss a rock for luck?
Did he soak up water
and climb into light and turn and turn?
Did he weep and weep in the yard?
Yes, I think he did. Yes,
now I think he did.
So, Willow, you come sweep my floor.
I have no store.
I have a yard. A big yard.
I have a song to weep.
I have a cry.
You who rose up from the dirt,
because I put you there
and like to walk my head in under
your earliest feathery branches—
what can it mean
when a thing is so easy?
It means you are a boy.
The glories of the world struck me, made me aria, once. 
—What happen then, Mr Bones? 
if be you cares to say. 
—Henry. Henry became interested in women's bodies, 
his loins were & were the    scene of stupendous achievement. 
Stupor. Knees, dear. Pray. 
All the knobs & softnesses of, my God, 
the ducking & trouble it swarm on Henry, 
at one time. 
—What happen then, Mr Bones? 
you seems excited-like. 
—Fell Henry back into    the original crime: art, rime 
besides a sense of others, my God, my God, 
and a jealousy for the honour (alive) of his country, 
what can get more odd? 
and discontent with the thriving gangs & pride. 
—What happen then, Mr Bones? 
—I had a most marvellous    piece of luck. I died.
Your face broods from my table, Suicide.
Your force came on like a torrent toward the end
of agony and wrath.
You were christened in the beginning Sylvia Plath
and changed that name for Mrs Hughes and bred
and went on round the bend
till the oven seemed the proper place for you.
I brood upon your face, the geography of grief,
hooded, till I allow
again your resignation from us now
though the screams of orphaned children fix me anew.
Your torment here was brief,
long falls your exit all repeatingly,
a poor exemplum, one more suicide,
to stack upon the others
till stricken Henry with his sisters & brothers
suddenly gone pauses to wonder why he
alone breasts the wronging tide.
I caught a tremendous fish
and held him beside the boat
half out of water, with my hook
fast in a corner of his mouth.
He didn't fight.
He hadn't fought at all.
He hung a grunting weight,
battered and venerable
and homely. Here and there
his brown skin hung in strips
like ancient wallpaper,
and its pattern of darker brown
was like wallpaper:
shapes like full-blown roses
stained and lost through age.
He was speckled and barnacles,
fine rosettes of lime,
and infested
with tiny white sea-lice,
and underneath two or three
rags of green weed hung down.
While his gills were breathing in
the terrible oxygen
--the frightening gills,
fresh and crisp with blood,
that can cut so badly--
I thought of the coarse white flesh
packed in like feathers,
the big bones and the little bones,
the dramatic reds and blacks
of his shiny entrails,
and the pink swim-bladder
like a big peony.
I looked into his eyes
which were far larger than mine
but shallower, and yellowed,
the irises backed and packed
with tarnished tinfoil
seen through the lenses
of old scratched isinglass.
They shifted a little, but not
to return my stare.
--It was more like the tipping
of an object toward the light.
I admired his sullen face,
the mechanism of his jaw,
and then I saw
that from his lower lip
--if you could call it a lip
grim, wet, and weaponlike,
hung five old pieces of fish-line,
or four and a wire leader
with the swivel still attached,
with all their five big hooks
grown firmly in his mouth.
A green line, frayed at the end
where he broke it, two heavier lines,
and a fine black thread
still crimped from the strain and snap
when it broke and he got away.
Like medals with their ribbons
frayed and wavering,
a five-haired beard of wisdom
trailing from his aching jaw.
I stared and stared
and victory filled up
the little rented boat,
from the pool of bilge
where oil had spread a rainbow
around the rusted engine
to the bailer rusted orange,
the sun-cracked thwarts,
the oarlocks on their strings,
the gunnels--until everything
was rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!
And I let the fish go. 
Sometimes farm granaries become especially beautiful when all the oats or wheat are gone, and wind has swept the rough floor clean. Standing inside, we see around us, coming in through the cracks between shrunken wall boards, bands or strips of sunlight. So in a poem about imprisonment, one sees a little light.
But how many birds have died trapped in these granaries. The bird, seeing freedom in the light, flutters up the walls and falls back again and again. The way out is where the rats enter and leave; but the rat's hole is low to the floor. Writers, be careful then by showing the sunlight on the walls not to promise the anxious and panicky blackbirds a way out!
I say to the reader, beware. Readers who love poems of light may sit hunched in the corner with nothing in their gizzards for four days, light failing, the eyes glazed...They may end as a mound of feathers and a skull on the open boardwood floor...
The Russians had few doctors on the front line.
My father's job was this: after the battle
Was over, he'd walk among the men hit,
Sit down and ask: 'Would you like to die on your
Own in a few hours, or should I finish it?'
Most said, 'Don't leave me.' The two would have
A cigarette. He'd take out his small notebook—
We had no dogtags, you know— and write the man's
Name down, his wife's, his children, his address, and what
He wanted to say. When the the cigarette was done,
The soldier would turn his head to the side. My father
Finished off four hundred men that way during the war.
He never went crazy. They were his people.
He came to Toronto. My father in the summers
Would stand on the lawn with a hose, watering
The grass that way. It took a long time. He'd talk
To the moon, to the wind. 'I can hear you growing'—
He'd say to the grass. 'We come and go.
We're no different from each other. We are all
Part of something. We have a home.' When I was thirteen,
I said, 'Dad, do you know they've invented sprinklers
Now?' He went on watering the grass.
'This is my life. Just shut up if you don't understand it.'
Let it be alleys. Let it be a hall
Whose janitor javelins epithet and thought
To cheapen hyacinth darkness that we sought
And played we found, rot, make the petals fall.
Let it be stairways, and splintery box
Where you have thrown me, scraped me with your kiss,
Have honed me, have released me after this
Cavern kindness, smiled away our shocks.
This is the birthright of our lovely love.
In swaddling clothes. Not like that Other one.
Nor lit by any fondling star above.
Nor found by any wise men, either. Run.
People are coming. They must not catch us here
Definitionless in this strict atmosphere.
I walk and I rest while the eyes of my dead
look through my own, inaudible
hosannas greet
the panorama charged serene
and almost ultraviolet with so much witness.
Holy the sea, the palpitating membrane
divided into dazzling fields and whaledark by the sun.
among the rocks
at walnut grove
your silence drumming
in my bones,
tell me your names.
nobody mentioned slaves
and yet the curious tools
shine with your fingerprints.
nobody mentioned slaves
but somebody did this work
who had no guide, no stone,
who moulders under rock.
tell me your names,
tell me your bashful names
and i will testify.
the inventory lists ten slaves
but only men were recognized.
among the rocks
at walnut grove
some of these honored dead
were dark
some of these dark
were slaves
some of these slaves
were women
some of them did this
honored work.
tell me your names
foremothers, brothers,
tell me your dishonored names.
here lies
here lies
here lies
here lies
hear
we will learn
to live together.
i will call you
ribbon of hunger
and desire
empty pocket flap
edge of before and after.
and you
what will you call me?
woman i ride
and who cannot throw me
and i will not fall off.
Today I pass the time reading
a favorite haiku,
saying the few words over and over.
It feels like eating
the same small, perfect grape
again and again.
I walk through the house reciting it
and leave its letters falling
through the air of every room.
I stand by the big silence of the piano and say it.
I say it in front of a painting of the sea.
I tap out its rhythm on an empty shelf.
I listen to myself saying it,
then I say it without listening,
then I hear it without saying it.
And when the dog looks up at me,
I kneel down on the floor
and whisper it into each of his long white ears.
It's the one about the one-ton temple bell
with the moth sleeping on its surface,
and every time I say it, I feel the excruciating
pressure of the moth
on the surface of the iron bell.
When I say it at the window,
the bell is the world
and I am the moth resting there.
When I say it at the mirror,
I am the heavy bell
and the moth is life with its papery wings.
And later, when I say it to you in the dark,
you are the bell,
and I am the tongue of the bell, ringing you,
and the moth has flown
from its line
and moves like a hinge in the air above our bed. 
I imagined the atmosphere would be clear,
shot with pristine light,
not this sulphurous haze,
the air ionized as before a thunderstorm.
Many have pictured a river here,
but no one mentioned all the boats,
their benches crowded with naked passengers,
each bent over a writing tablet.
I knew I would not always be a child
with a model train and a model tunnel,
and I knew I would not live forever,
jumping all day through the hoop of myself.
I had heard about the journey to the other side
and the clink of the final coin
in the leather purse of the man holding the oar,
but how could anyone have guessed
that as soon as we arrived
we would be asked to describe this place
and to include as much detail as possible—
not just the water, he insists,
rather the oily, fathomless, rat-happy water,
not simply the shackles, but the rusty,
iron, ankle-shredding shackles—
and that our next assignment would be
to jot down, off the tops of our heads,
our thoughts and feelings about being dead,
not really an assignment,
the man rotating the oar keeps telling us—
think of it more as an exercise, he groans,
think of writing as a process,
a never-ending, infernal process,
and now the boats have become jammed together,
bow against stern, stern locked to bow,
and not a thing is moving, only our diligent pens.
Locate I
love you some-
where in
teeth and   
eyes, bite   
it but
take care not   
to hurt, you   
want so
much so   
little. Words   
say everything.
I
love you
again,
then what   
is emptiness   
for. To
fill, fill.
I heard words   
and words full
of holes   
aching. Speech   
is a mouth.
For love – I would
split open your head and put
a candle in
behind the eyes.
 
Love is dead in us
if we forget
the virtues of an amulet
and quick surprise. 
We have all been in rooms
We cannot die in, and they are odd places, and sad.
Often Indians are standing eagle-armed on hills 
 
In the sunrise open wide to the Great Spirit
Or gliding in canoes or cattle are browsing on the walls
Far away gazing down with the eyes of our children 
 
Not far away or there are men driving
The last railspike, which has turned
Gold in their hands. Gigantic forepleasure lives 
 
Among such scenes, and we are alone with it
At last. There is always some weeping
Between us and someone is always checking 
 
A wrist watch by the bed to see how much
Longer we have left. Nothing can come
Of this nothing can come 
 
Of us: of me with my grim techniques
Or you who have sealed your womb
With a ring of convulsive rubber: 
 
Although we come together,
Nothing will come of us. But we would not give
It up, for death is beaten 
 
By praying Indians by distant cows historical
Hammers by hazardous meetings that bridge
A continent. One could never die here 
 
Never die never die
While crying. My lover, my dear one
I will see you next week 
 
When I'm in town. I will call you
If I can. Please get hold of Please don't
Oh God, Please don't any more I can't bear... Listen: 
 
We have done it again we are
Still living. Sit up and smile,
God bless you. Guilt is magical. 
A woman travels to Brazil for plastic
surgery and a face-lift. She is sixty
and has the usual desire to stay pretty.
Once she is healed, she takes her new face
out on the streets of Rio. A young man
with a gun wants her money. Bang, she’s dead.
The body is shipped back to New York,
but in the morgue there is a mix-up. The son
is sent for. He is told that his mother
is one of these ten different women.
Each has been shot. Such is modern life.
He studies them all but can’t find her.
With her new face, she has become a stranger.
Maybe it’s this one, maybe it’s that one.
He looks at their breasts. Which ones nursed him?
He presses their hands to his cheek.
Which ones consoled him? He even tries
climbing onto their laps to see which
feels most familiar but the coroner stops him.
Well, says the coroner, which is your mother?
They all are, says the young man, let me
take them as a package. The coroner hesitates,
then agrees. Actually, it solved a lot of problems.
The young man has the ten women shipped home,
then cremates them all together. You’ve seen
how some people have a little urn on the mantel?
This man has a huge silver garbage can.
In the spring, he drags the garbage can
out to the garden and begins working the teeth,
the ash, the bits of bone into the soil.
Then he plants tomatoes. His mother loved tomatoes.
They grow straight from seed, so fast and big
that the young man is amazed. He takes the first
ten into the kitchen. In their roundness,
he sees his mother’s breasts. In their smoothness
he finds the consoling touch of her hands.
Mother, mother, he cries, and flings himself
on the tomatoes. Forget about the knife, the fork,
the pinch of salt. Try to imagine the filial
starvation, think of his ravenous kisses.
Now there is a slit in the blue fabric of air.
His house spins faster. He holds down books,
chairs; his life and its objects fly upward:
vanishing black specks in the indifferent sky.
The sky is a torn piece of blue paper.
He tries to repair it, but the memory
of death is like paste on his fingers
and certain days stick like dead flies.
Say the sky goes back to being the sky
and the sun continues as always. Now,
knowing what you know, how can you not see
thin cracks in the fragile blue vaults of air.
My friend, what can I give you or darkness
lift from you but fragments of language,
fragments of blue sky. You had three
beautiful daughters and one has died.
(Independence Day, 1964)
On her 36th birthday, Thomas had shown her   
her first swimming pool. It had been
his favorite color, exactly—just
so much of it, the swimmers’ white arms jutting   
into the chevrons of high society.
She had rolled up her window
and told him to drive on, fast.
Now this act of mercy: four daughters
dragging her to their husbands’ company picnic,   
white families on one side and them
on the other, unpacking the same
squeeze bottles of Heinz, the same
waxy beef patties and Salem potato chip bags.   
So he was dead for the first time
on Fourth of July—ten years ago
had been harder, waiting for something to happen,   
and ten years before that, the girls
like young horses eyeing the track.
Last August she stood alone for hours
in front of the T.V. set
as a crow’s wing moved slowly through
the white streets of government.
That brave swimming
scared her, like Joanna saying   
Mother, we’re Afro-Americans now!
What did she know about Africa?   
Were there lakes like this one
with a rowboat pushed under the pier?   
Or Thomas’ Great Mississippi
with its sullen silks? (There was
the Nile but the Nile belonged
to God.) Where she came from
was the past, 12 miles into town
where nobody had locked their back door,
and Goodyear hadn’t begun to dream of a park   
under the company symbol, a white foot   
sprouting two small wings.
The architect wanted to build a stairway
and suspend it with silver, almost invisible
guy wires in a high-ceilinged room,
a stairway you couldn't ascend or descend except in your dreams. But first —
because wild things are not easily seen
if what's around them is wild —
he'd make sure the house that housed it
was practical, built two-by-four by
two-by-four, slat by slat, without ornament.
The stairway would be an invitation
to anyone who felt invited by it,
and depending on your reaction he'd know
if friendship were possible.
The house he'd claim as his, but the stairway
would be designed to be ownerless,
tilted against any suggestion of a theology,
disappointing to those looking for politics.
Of course the architect knew
that over the years he'd have to build
other things the way others desired, 
knew that to live in this world was to trade
a few industrious hours for one beautiful one.
Yet every night when he got home
he could imagine, as he walked in the door,
his stairway going nowhere, not for sale,
and maybe some you to whom nothing
about it need be explained, waiting,
the wine decanted, the night about to unfold.
The antelope are strange people ... they are beautiful to look at, and yet they are tricky. We do not trust them. They appear and disappear; they are like shadows on the plains. Because of their great beauty, young men sometimes follow the antelope and are lost forever. Even if those foolish ones find themselves and return, they are never again right in their heads.
All night I am the doe, breathing   
his name in a frozen field,
the small mist of the word
drifting always before me.
And again he has heard it   
and I have gone burning   
to meet him, the jacklight   
fills my eyes with blue fire;   
the heart in my chest
explodes like a hot stone.
Then slung like a sack
in the back of his pickup,
I wipe the death scum
from my mouth, sit up laughing   
and shriek in my speeding grave.
Safely shut in the garage,
when he sharpens his knife
and thinks to have me, like that,
I come toward him,
a lean gray witch
through the bullets that enter and dissolve.
I sit in his house
drinking coffee till dawn
and leave as frost reddens on hubcaps,
crawling back into my shadowy body.
All day, asleep in clean grasses,
I dream of the one who could really wound me.   
Not with weapons, not with a kiss, not with a look.   
Not even with his goodness.
If a man was never to lie to me. Never lie me.
I swear I would never leave him.
The night was clean as the bone of a rabbit blown hollow.
I cast my hood of dogskin
away, and my shirt of nettles.
Ten years had been enough. I left my darkened house.
The trick was in living that death to its source.
When it happened, I wandered toward more than I was.
Widowed by men, I married the dark firs,
As if I were walking in sleep toward their arms.
I drank, without fear or desire,
this odd fire.
Now shadows move freely within me as words.
These are eternal, these stunned, loosened verbs.
And I can’t tell you yet
how truly I belong
to the hiss and shift of wind,
these slow, variable mouths
through which, at certain times, I speak in tongues.
Think of the queen mole who is unequivocal,
exuding a scent to keep the other females neuter
and bringing forth the colonly’s only babies, hairless and pink in the
dark
of her tunneled chamber. She may chew a pale something, a root,
find it tasteless, drop it for the dreary others to take away, then
demand
more; she must suckle the young. Of course
they all hate her and are jealous of the attention given her
by her six bedmates. In their mutual dream she is dead and her urine
no longer arrests their maturing. As irises infallibly unfold,
one of their own will feel her sex grow quickest and greatest. As they
dig
together, their snouts full of soil, they hope this and are ruthless in
their waiting.
They took off their clothes 1000 nights
and felt the plaster of the moon
sift over them, and the ground roll
them in its dream. Little did they know
the light light and clay and their own sweat
became a skin they couldn't wash away.
Each night bonded to the next,
and they grew stiffer. They noticed this
in sunlight - there were calluses,
round tough moons on their extremities,
shadows under their eyes,
and sometimes a faint sour smell they hadn't had as children.
It worried them, but at night the animal
in their bodies overcame their reluctance
to be naked with each other,
and the mineral moon did its work.
At last when they woke up and were dead,
statues on their backs in the park,
they opened their mouths
and crawled out, pitifully soft and small,
not yet souls.
Into the changes of autumn brush
the doe walked, and the hide, head, and ears
were the tinsel browns. They made her.
I could not see her. She reappeared, stuffed with apples,
and I shot her. Into the pines she ran,
and I ran after. I might have lost her,
seeing no sign of blood or scuffle,
but felt myself part of the woods,
a woman with a doe’s ears, and heard her
dying, counted her last breaths like a song
of dying, and found her dying.
I shot her again because her lungs rattled like castanets,
then poked her with the gun barrel
because her eyes were dusty and unreal.
I opened her belly and pushed the insides
like rotted fruit into a rabbit hole,
skinned her, broke her leg joints under my knee,
took the meat, smelled the half-digested smell
that was herself. Ah, I closed her eyes.
I left her refolded in some briars
with the last sun on her head
like a benediction, head tilted on its axis
of neck and barren bone; head bent
wordless over a death, though I heard
the night wind blowing through her fur,
heard riot in the emptied head.
There was an apple tree in the yard --
this would have been
forty years ago -- behind,
only meadows. Drifts
of crocus in the damp grass.
I stood at that window:
late April. Spring
flowers in the neighbor's yard.
How many times, really, did the tree
flower on my birthday,
the exact day, not
before, not after? Substitution
of the immutable
for the shifting, the evolving.
Substitution of the image
for relentless earth. What
do I know of this place,
the role of the tree for decades
taken by a bonsai, voices
rising from the tennis courts --
Fields. Smell of the tall grass, new cut.
As one expects of a lyric poet.
We look at the world once, in childhood.
The rest is memory. 
I have a friend who still believes in heaven.
Not a stupid person, yet with all she knows, she literally talks to God.
She thinks someone listens in heaven.
On earth she's unusually competent.
Brave too, able to face unpleasantness.
We found a caterpillar dying in the dirt, greedy ants crawling over it.
I'm always moved by disaster, always eager to oppose vitality
But timid also, quick to shut my eyes.
Whereas my friend was able to watch, to let events play out
According to nature. For my sake she intervened
Brushing a few ants off the torn thing, and set it down
Across the road.
My friend says I shut my eyes to God, that nothing else explains
My aversion to reality. She says I'm like the child who
Buries her head in the pillow
So as not to see, the child who tells herself
That light causes sadness-
My friend is like the mother. Patient, urging me
To wake up an adult like herself, a courageous person-
In my dreams, my friend reproaches me. We're walking
On the same road, except it's winter now;
She's telling me that when you love the world you hear celestial music:
Look up, she says. When I look up, nothing.
Only clouds, snow, a white business in the trees
Like brides leaping to a great height-
Then I'm afraid for her; I see her
Caught in a net deliberately cast over the earth-
In reality, we sit by the side of the road, watching the sun set;
From time to time, the silence pierced by a birdcall.
It's this moment we're trying to explain, the fact
That we're at ease with death, with solitude.
My friend draws a circle in the dirt; inside, the caterpillar doesn't move.
She's always trying to make something whole, something beautiful, an image
Capable of life apart from her.
We're very quiet. It's peaceful sitting here, not speaking, The composition
Fixed, the road turning suddenly dark, the air
Going cool, here and there the rocks shining and glittering-
It's this stillness we both love.
The love of form is a love of endings. 
The drizzle-slicked cobblestone alleys 
of some city; 
                      and the brickwork back 
of the lumbering Galapagos tortoise 
they'd set me astride, at the "petting zoo"....
The taste of our squabble still in my mouth 
the next day; 
                      and the brackish puddles sectioning 
the street one morning after a storm....
So poetry configures its comparisons. 
My wife and I have been arguing; now 
I'm telling her a childhood reminiscence, 
stroking her back, her naked back that was 
the particles in the heart of a star and will be 
again, and is hers, and is like nothing 
else, and is like the components of everything. 
What will become of her earliest memory --
the sperm whale battling the giant squid
in the dark exhibition at the museum?
looking up at 3 am
to see her sister pressed against two white breasts?
or maybe her yellow room
filled with the noise of boys in the vacant lot:
bang, boom-boom, fuckyoufuckyoufuck you.
When Jane felt well enough for me to leave her
for a whole day, I drove south by the river
to empty my mother Lucy's house in Connecticut.
I hurried from room to room, cellar to attic,
opening a crammed closet, then turning
to discover a chest with five full drawers.
I labelled for shipping sofas and chairs,
bedroom sets, and tables; I wrapped figurines
and fancy teacups in paper, preserving things
she cherished--and dreaded, in her last years,
might go for a nickel on the Spring Glen lawn.
Everywhere I looked I saw shelves and tabletops
covered with Lucy's glass animals and music boxes.
Everywhere in closets, decades of dresses hung
in dead air. I carried garbage bags in one hand,
and with the other swept my mother's leftover
possessions into sacks for the Hamden dump.
I stuffed bags full of blouses, handkerchiefs,
and the green-gold dress she wore to Bermuda.
At the last moment I discovered and saved
a cut-glass tumbler, stained red at the top,
Lucy 1905 scripted on the stain. In the garage
I piled the clanking bags, then drove four hours
north with my hands tight on the Honda's wheel,
drank a beer looking through Saturday's mail,
pitched into bed beside Jane fitfully asleep,
and woke exhausted from rolling unendable
nightmares of traffic and fire. In my dreams
I grieved or mourned interchangeably for Lucy,
for Lucy's things, for Jane, and for me.
When I woke, I rose as if from a drunken sleep
after looting a city and burning its temples.
All day as I ate lunch or counted out pills,
or as we lay weeping, hugging in bed together,
I counted precious things from our twenty years:
a blue vase, a candelabrum Jane carried on her lap
from the Baja, and the small porcelain box
from France I found under the tree one Christmas
where a couple in relief stretch out asleep,
like a catafalque, on the pastel double bed
of the box's top, both wearing pretty nightcaps.
I reach from pain
to music great enough
to bring me back,
swollenhead, madness,
lovefruit, a pickle of hate
so sour my mouth twicked
up and would not sing;
there's nothing in the beat
to hold it in
melody and turn human skin;
a brown berry gone
to rot just two days on the branch;
we've lost a son,
the music, jazz, comes in.
In white,
the unpainted statue of the young girl
on the side altar
made the quality of mercy seem scrupulous and calm.
When my mother was in a hospital drying out,
or drinking at a pace that would put her there soon,
I would slip in the side door,
light an aromatic candle,
and bargain for us both.
Or else I'd stare into the day-moon of that face
and, if I concentrated, fly.
Come down! come down!
she'd call, because I was so high.
Though mostly when I think of myself
at that age, I am standing at my older brother's closet
studying the shirts,
convinced that I could be absolutely transformed
by something I could borrow.
And the days churned by,
navigable sorrow.
The child brought blue clay from the creek
and the woman made two figures: a lady and a deer.
At that season deer came down from the mountain
and fed quietly in the redwood canyons.
The woman and the child regarded the figure of the lady,
the crude roundnesses, the grace, the coloring like shadow.
They were not sure where she came from,
except the child's fetching and the woman's hands
and the lead-blue clay of the creek
where the deer sometimes showed themselves at sundown.
Sundays too my father got up early
And put his clothes on in the blueback cold,
then with cracked hands that ached
from labor in the weekday weather made
banked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.
I'd wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.
When the rooms were warm, he'd call,
and slowly I would rise and dress,
fearing the chronic angers of that house,
Speaking indifferently to him,
who had driven out the cold
and polished my good shoes as well.
What did I know, what did I know
of love's austere and lonely offices? 
Which is our star this night?
Belsen is bathed in blue,
every footworn lane, every
strand of wire, pale blue.
The guards' bodies,
the prisoners' bodies--all
black and invisible.  Only
their pale blue eyes
float above the lanes
or between the wires.
Or they are all dead,
and these are the blue eyes of those
haunted by what happened here.
Which eyes are yours,
which mine?  Even
blue-eyed crows
drift the darkness overhead.  Even
blue-eyed worms
sip dew from the weeping leaves
of the black Erika
over the graves....
But now, at once, every
eye, every blue light
closes.  As we do.
For rest.  For now.
Which was our star this night?
Our father liked to play a game.   
He played that he was dead.   
He took his thick black glasses off   
and stretched out on the bed.
He wouldn’t twitch and didn’t snore
or move in any way.
He didn’t even seem to breathe!
We asked, Are you okay?
We tickled fingers up and down
his huge, pink, stinky feet—
He didn’t move; he lay as still
as last year’s parakeet.
We pushed our fingers up his nose,
and wiggled them inside—
Next, we peeled his eyelids back.
Are you okay? we cried.
I really thought he might be dead
and not just playing possum,
because his eyeballs didn’t twitch
when I slid my tongue across ’em.
He’s dead, we sobbed—but to be sure,
I jabbed him in the jewels.
He rose, like Jesus, from the dead,
though I don’t think Jesus drools.
His right hand lashed both right and left.
His left hand clutched his scrotum.
And the words he yelled—I know damn well
I’m way too young to quote ’em.
You might come here Sunday on a whim.
Say your life broke down. The last good kiss
you had was years ago. You walk these streets
laid out by the insane, past hotels
that didn't last, bars that did, the tortured try
of local drivers to accelerate their lives.
Only churches are kept up. The jail
turned 70 this year. The only prisoner
is always in, not knowing what he's done.
The principal supporting business now
is rage. Hatred of the various grays
the mountain sends, hatred of the mill,
The Silver Bill repeal, the best liked girls
who leave each year for Butte. One good
restaurant and bars can't wipe the boredom out.
The 1907 boom, eight going silver mines,
a dance floor built on springs--
all memory resolves itself in gaze,
in panoramic green you know the cattle eat
or two stacks high above the town,
two dead kilns, the huge mill in collapse
for fifty years that won't fall finally down.
Isn't this your life? That ancient kiss
still burning out your eyes? Isn't this defeat
so accurate, the church bell simply seems
a pure announcement: ring and no one comes?
Don't empty houses ring? Are magnesium
and scorn sufficient to support a town,
not just Philipsburg, but towns
of towering blondes, good jazz and booze
the world will never let you have
until the town you came from dies inside?
Say no to yourself. The old man, twenty
when the jail was built, still laughs
although his lips collapse. Someday soon,
he says, I'll go to sleep and not wake up.
You tell him no. You're talking to yourself.
The car that brought you here still runs.
The money you buy lunch with,
no matter where it's mined, is silver
and the girl who serves your food
is slender and her red hair lights the wall. 
It's snowing this afternoon and there are no flowers.
There is only this sound of falling, quiet and remote,
Like the memory of scales descending the white keys
Of a childhood piano--outside the window, palms!
And the heavy head of the cereus, inclining,
Soon to let down its white or yellow-white.
Now, only these poor snow-flowers in a heap,
Like the memory of a white dress cast down . . . 
So much has fallen.
                                 And I, who have listened for a step
All afternoon, hear it now, but already falling away,
Already in memory. And the terrible scales descending
On the silent piano; the snow; and the absent flowers abounding.
Me moriré en Paris con aguacero ... 
I will die in Miami in the sun, 
On a day when the sun is very bright, 
A day like the days I remember, a day like other days, 
A day that nobody knows or remembers yet, 
And the sun will be bright then on the dark glasses of strangers 
And in the eyes of a few friends from my childhood 
And of the surviving cousins by the graveside, 
While the diggers, standing apart, in the still shade of the palms, 
Rest on their shovels, and smoke, 
Speaking in Spanish softly, out of respect. 

I think it will be on a Sunday like today, 
Except that the sun will be out, the rain will have stopped, 
And the wind that today made all the little shrubs kneel down; 
And I think it will be a Sunday because today, 
When I took out this paper and began to write, 
Never before had anything looked so blank, 
My life, these words, the paper, the gray Sunday; 
And my dog, quivering under a table because of the storm, 
Looked up at me, not understanding, 
And my son read on without speaking, and my wife slept. 

Donald Justice is dead. One Sunday the sun came out, 
It shone on the bay, it shone on the white buildings, 
The cars moved down the street slowly as always, so many, 
Some with their headlights on in spite of the sun, 
And after awhile the diggers with their shovels 
Walked back to the graveside through the sunlight, 
And one of them put his blade into the earth 
To lift a few clods of dirt, the black marl of Miami, 
And scattered the dirt, and spat, 
Turning away abruptly, out of respect. 
For I can snore like a bullhorn 
or play loud music
or sit up talking with any reasonably sober Irishman 
and Fergus will only sink deeper
into his dreamless sleep, which goes by all in one flash, 
but let there be that heavy breathing
or a stifled come-cry anywhere in the house 
and he will wrench himself awake 
and make for it on the run—as now, we lie together, 
after making love, quiet, touching along the length of our bodies, 
familiar touch of the long-married, 
and he appears—in his baseball pajamas, it happens, 
the neck opening so small he has to screw them on—
and flops down between us and hugs us and snuggles himself to sleep, 
his face gleaming with satisfaction at being this very child.
In the half darkness we look at each other 
and smile
and touch arms across this little, startlingly muscled body—
this one whom habit of memory propels to the ground of his making, 
sleeper only the mortal sounds can sing awake, 
this blessing love gives again into our arms.
I love to go out in late September
among the fat, overripe, icy, black blackberries
to eat blackberries for breakfast,
the stalks very prickly, a penalty
they earn for knowing the black art
of blackberry-making; and as I stand among them
lifting the stalks to my mouth, the ripest berries
fall almost unbidden to my tongue,
as words sometimes do, certain peculiar words
like strengths or squinched,
many-lettered, one-syllabled lumps,
which I squeeze, squinch open, and splurge well
in the silent, startled, icy, black language
of blackberry -- eating in late September.
The room is sparsely furnished:
A chair, a table, and a father.
He sits in the chair by the window.
There are books on the table.
The time is always just past lunch.
You tiptoe past as he eats his apple
And reads. He looks up, angry.
He has heard your asthmatic breathing.
He will read for years without looking up
Until your childhood is safely over:
Smells, untidiness, and boring questions;
Blood from the first skinned knees
To the first stained thighs;
The foolish tears of adolescent love.
One day he looks up, pleased
At the finished product,
Now he is ready to love you!
So he coaxes you in the voice reserved
For reading Keats. You agree to everything.
Drilled in silence and duty,
You will give him no cause for reproach.
He will boast of you to strangers.
When the afternoon is older
Shadows in a small room
Fall on he bed, the books, the father.
You read aloud to him
“La Belle Dame sans Merci." 
You feed him his medicine.
You tell him you love him.
You wait for his eyes to close at last
So you may write this poem.
My mother—preferring the strange to the tame:
Dove-note, bone marrow, deer dung,
Frog’s belly distended with finny young,
Leaf-mold wilderness, harebell, toadstool,
Odd, small snakes roving through the leaves,
Metallic beetles rambling over stones: all
Wild and natural!—flashed out her instinctive love, and quick, she   
Picked up the fluttering, bleeding bat the cat laid at her feet,   
And held the little horror to the mirror, where
He gazed on himself, and shrieked like an old screen door far off.
Depended from her pinched thumb, each wing
Came clattering down like a small black shutter.
Still tranquil, she began, “It’s rather sweet ...”
The soft mouse body, the hard feral glint
In the caught eyes. Then we saw,
And recoiled: lice, pallid, yellow,
Nested within the wing-pits, cozily sucked and snoozed.   
The thing dropped from her hands, and with its thud,
Swiftly, the cat, with a clean careful mouth
Closed on the soiled webs, growling, took them out to the back stoop.
But still, dark blood, a sticky puddle on the floor   
Remained, of all my mother’s tender, wounding passion   
For a whole wild, lost, betrayed, and secret life   
Among its dens and burrows, its clean stones,   
Whose denizens can turn upon the world   
With spitting tongue, an odor, talon, claw,   
To sting or soil benevolence, alien
As our clumsy traps, our random scatter of shot.   
She swept to the kitchen. Turning on the tap,   
She washed and washed the pity from her hands.
My black face fades,
hiding inside the black granite.
I said I wouldn't,
dammit: No tears. 
I'm stone. I'm flesh.
My clouded reflection eyes me
like a bird of prey, the profile of night
slanted against morning. I turn
this way--the stone lets me go.
I turn that way--I'm inside
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
again, depending on the light
to make a difference.
I go down the 58,022 names,
half-expecting to find
my own in letters like smoke.
I touch the name Andrew Johnson;
I see the booby trap's white flash.
Names shimmer on a woman's blouse
but when she walks away
the names stay on the wall.
Brushstrokes flash, a red bird's 
wings cutting across my stare.
The sky. A plane in the sky.
A white vet's image floats
closer to me, then his pale eyes
look through mine. I'm a window.
He's lost his right arm
inside the stone. In the black mirror
a woman's trying to erase names:
No, she's brushing a boy's hair.
I know salt marshes that move along like one big
trembling wing. I've noticed insects
shiny as gold in a blues singer's teeth
& more keenly calibrated than a railroad watch,
but at heart I'm another breed.
The audacity of the lower gods—
whatever we name we own.
Diversiloba, we say, unfolding poison oak.
Lovers go untouched as we lean from bay windows
with telescopes trained on a yellow sky.
I'd rather let the flowers
keep doing what they do best.
Unblessing each petal,
letting go a year's worth of white
death notes, busily unnaming themselves.
In the Defense Department there is a shop
where scientists sew the eyelids of rabbits open
lest they blink in the scorch of a nuclear drop
 
and elsewhere dolphins are being taught to defuse
bombs in the mock-up of a harbor and monkeys
learn to perform the simple tasks of draftees.
 
It is done with electric shocks. Some mice
who have failed their time tests in the maze
now go to the wire unbidden for their jolts.
 
Implanting electrodes yields rich results:
alley cats turn from predators into prey.
Show them a sparrow and they cower
 
while the whitewall labs fill up with the feces of fear
where calves whose hearts have been done away
with walk and bleat on plastic pumps.
 
And what is any of this to the godhead,
these squeals, whines, writhings, unexpected jumps,
whose children burn alive, booby-trap the dead,
lop ears and testicles, core and disembowel?
 
It all ends at the hole. No words may enter
the house of excrement. We will meet there
as the sphincter of the good Lord opens wide
and He takes us all inside.
From a documentary on marsupials I learn
that a pillowcase makes a fine
substitute pouch for an orphaned kangaroo.
 
I am drawn to such dramas of animal rescue.
They are warm in the throat. I suffer, the critic proclaims,
from an overabundance of maternal genes.
 
Bring me your fallen fledgling, your bummer lamb,
lead the abused, the starvelings, into my barn.
Advise the hunted deer to leap into my corn.
 
And had there been a wild child –
filthy and fierce as a ferret, he is called
in one nineteenth-century account –
 
a wild child to love, it is safe to assume,
given my fireside inked with paw prints,
there would have been room.
 
Think of the language we two, same and not-same
might have constructed from sign,
scratch, grimace, grunt, vowel:
 
Laughter our first noun, and our long verb. howl.
Some things I do not profess 
to understand, perhaps
not wanting to, including
whatever it was they did
with you or you with them
that timeless summer day
when you stumbled out of the wood,
distracted, with your white blouse torn
and a bloodstain on your skirt.
"Do you believe?" you asked.
Between us, through the years,
we pieced enough together
to make the story real:
how you encountered on the path
a pack of sleek, grey hounds,
trailed by a dumbshow retinue
in leather shrouds; and how
you were led, through leafy ways,
into the presence of a royal stag,
flaming in his chestnut coat,
who kneeled on a swale of moss
before you; and how you were borne
aloft in triumph through the green,
stretched on his rack of budding horn,
till suddenly you found yourself alone
in a trampled clearing.
That was a long time ago,
almost another age, but even now, 
when I hold you in my arms, 
I wonder where you are.
Sometimes I wake to hear
the engines of the night thrumming
outside the east bay window
on the lawn spreading to the rose garden.
You lie beside me in elegant repose,
a hint of transport hovering on your lips,
indifferent to the harsh green flares
that swivel through the room,
searchlights controlled by unseen hands.
Out there is a childhood country,
bleached faces peering in
with coals for eyes.
Our lives are spinning out
from world to world;
the shapes of things
are shifting in the wind.
What do we know
beyond the rapture and the dread?
It's late. I've come
to find the flower which blossoms
like a saint dying upside down.
The rose won't do, nor the iris.
I've come to find the moody one, the shy one,
downcast, grave, and isolated.
Now, blackness gathers in the grass,
and I am on my hands and knees.
What is its name?
Little sister, my indigo,
my secret, vaginal and sweet,
you unfurl yourself shamelessly
toward the ground. You burn. You live
a while in two worlds
at once. 
I've pulled the last of the year's young onions. 
The garden is bare now. The ground is cold, 
brown and old. What is left of the day flames 
in the maples at the corner of my 
eye. I turn, a cardinal vanishes. 
By the cellar door, I wash the onions, 
then drink from the icy metal spigot. 
Once, years back, I walked beside my father 
among the windfall pears. I can't recall 
our words. We may have strolled in silence. But 
I still see him bend that way-left hand braced 
on knee, creaky-to lift and hold to my 
eye a rotten pear. In it, a hornet 
spun crazily, glazed in slow, glistening juice. 
It was my father I saw this morning 
waving to me from the trees. I almost 
called to him, until I came close enough 
to see the shovel, leaning where I had 
left it, in the flickering, deep green shade. 
White rice steaming, almost done. Sweet green peas 
fried in onions. Shrimp braised in sesame 
oil and garlic. And my own loneliness. 
What more could I, a young man, want.  
Those groans men use
passing a woman on the street
or on the steps of the subway
 
to tell her she is a female
and their flesh knows it,
 
are they a sort of tune,
an ugly enough song, sung
by a bird with a slit tongue
 
but meant for music?
 
Or are they the muffled roaring
of deafmutes trapped in a building that is
slowly filling with smoke?
 
Perhaps both.
 
Such men most often
look as if groan were all they could do,
yet a woman, in spite of herself,
 
knows it's a tribute:
if she were lacking all grace
they'd pass her in silence:
 
so it's not only to say she's
a warm hole. It's a word
 
in grief-language, nothing to do with
primitive, not an ur-language;
language stricken, sickened, cast down
 
in decrepitude. She wants to
throw the tribute away, dis-
gusted, and can't,
 
it goes on buzzing in her ear,
it changes the pace of her walk,
the torn posters in echoing corridors
 
spell it out, it
quakes and gnashes as the train comes in.
Her pulse sullenly
 
had picked up speed,
but the cars slow down and
jar to a stop while her understanding
 
keeps on translating:
'Life after life after life goes by
 
without poetry,
without seemliness,
without love.'
My wedding-ring lies in a basket 
as if at the bottom of a well. 
Nothing will come to fish it back up 
and onto my finger again. 
                    It lies 
among keys to abandoned houses, 
nails waiting to be needed and hammered 
into some wall, 
telephone numbers with no names attached, 
idle paperclips. 
          It can't be given away 
for fear of bringing ill-luck. 
          It can't be sold 
for the marriage was good in its own 
time, though that time is gone. 
          Could some artificer 
beat into it bright stones, transform it 
into a dazzling circlet no one could take 
for solemn betrothal or to make promises 
living will not let them keep? Change it 
into a simple gift I could give in friendship? 
Out of burlap sacks, out of bearing butter, 
Out of black bean and wet slate bread, 
Out of the acids of rage, the candor of tar, 
Out of creosote, gasoline, drive shafts, wooden dollies, 
They Lion grow. 
Out of the gray hills 
Of industrial barns, out of rain, out of bus ride, 
West Virginia to Kiss My Ass, out of buried aunties, 
Mothers hardening like pounded stumps, out of stumps, 
Out of the bones' need to sharpen and the muscles' to stretch, 
They Lion grow. 
Earth is eating trees, fence posts, 
Gutted cars, earth is calling in her little ones, 
"Come home, Come home!" From pig balls, 
From the ferocity of pig driven to holiness, 
From the furred ear and the full jowl come 
The repose of the hung belly, from the purpose 
They Lion grow. 
From the sweet glues of the trotters 
Come the sweet kinks of the fist, from the full flower 
Of the hams the thorax of caves, 
From "Bow Down" come "Rise Up," 
Come they Lion from the reeds of shovels, 
The grained arm that pulls the hands, 
They Lion grow. 
From my five arms and all my hands, 
From all my white sins forgiven, they feed, 
From my car passing under the stars, 
They Lion, from my children inherit, 
From the oak turned to a wall, they Lion, 
From they sack and they belly opened 
And all that was hidden burning on the oil-stained earth 
They feed they Lion and he comes. 
Listen
It's wonderful how I jog 
on four honed-down ivory toes 
my massive buttocks slipping 
like oiled parts with each light step. 
I'm to market. I can smell 
the sour, grooved block, I can smell 
the blade that opens the hole 
and the pudgy white fingers 
that shake out the intestines 
like a hankie. In my dreams 
the snouts drool on the marble, 
suffering children, suffering flies, 
suffering the consumers 
who won't meet their steady eyes 
for fear they could see. The boy 
who drives me along believes 
that any moment I'll fall 
on my side and drum my toes 
like a typewriter or squeal 
and shit like a new housewife 
discovering television, 
or that I'll turn like a beast 
cleverly to hook his teeth 
with my teeth. No. Not this pig. 
"The hot night makes us keep our bedroom windows open.
Our magnolia blossoms. Life begins to happen.
My hopped up husband drops his home disputes,
and hits the streets to cruise for prostitutes,
free-lancing out along the razor's edge.
This screwball might kill his wife, then take the pledge.
Oh the monotonous meanness of his lust...
It's the injustice...he is so unjust--
whiskey-blind, swaggering home at five.
My only thought is how to keep alive.
What makes him tick?Each night now I tie
ten dollars and his car key to my thigh...
Gored by the climacteric of his want,
he stalls above me like an elephant
How easily happiness begins by   
dicing onions. A lump of sweet butter   
slithers and swirls across the floor   
of the sauté pan, especially if its   
errant path crosses a tiny slick
of olive oil. Then a tumble of onions.
This could mean soup or risotto   
or chutney (from the Sanskrit
chatni, to lick). Slowly the onions   
go limp and then nacreous
and then what cookbooks call clear,   
though if they were eyes you could see
clearly the cataracts in them.
It’s true it can make you weep
to peel them, to unfurl and to tease   
from the taut ball first the brittle,   
caramel-colored and decrepit
papery outside layer, the least
recent the reticent onion
wrapped around its growing body,   
for there’s nothing to an onion
but skin, and it’s true you can go on   
weeping as you go on in, through   
the moist middle skins, the sweetest
and thickest, and you can go on   
in to the core, to the bud-like,   
acrid, fibrous skins densely   
clustered there, stalky and in-
complete, and these are the most   
pungent, like the nuggets of nightmare
and rage and murmury animal   
comfort that infant humans secrete.   
This is the best domestic perfume.   
You sit down to eat with a rumor
of onions still on your twice-washed   
hands and lift to your mouth a hint
of a story about loam and usual   
endurance. It’s there when you clean up   
and rinse the wine glasses and make   
a joke, and you leave the minutest   
whiff of it on the light switch,
later, when you climb the stairs.
Another evening we sprawled about discussing
Appearances. And it was the consensus
That while uncommon physical good looks
Continued to launch one, as before, in life
(Among its vaporous eddies and false claims),
Still, as one of us said into his beard,
"Without your intellectual and spiritual 
Values, man, you are sunk." No one but squared
The shoulders of their own unlovliness.
Long-suffering Charles, having cooked and served the meal,
Now brought out little tumblers finely etched
He filled with amber liquor and then passed.
"Say," said the same young man, "in Paris, France,
They do it this way"--bounding to his feet
And touching a lit match to our host's full glass.
A blue flame, gentle, beautiful, came, went
Above the surface. In a hush that fell
We heard the vessel crack. The contents drained
As who should step down from a crystal coach.
Steward of spirits, Charles's glistening hand
All at once gloved itself in eeriness.
The moment passed. He made two quick sweeps and
Was flesh again. "It couldn't matter less,"
He said, but with a shocked, unconscious glance
Into the mirror. Finding nothing changed,
He filled a fresh glass and sank down among us.
Look closely at the letters. Can you see,
entering (stage right), then floating full,
then heading off—so soon—
how like a little kohl-rimmed moon
o plots her course from b to d
—as y, unanswered, knocks at the stage door?
Looked at too long, words fail,
phase out. Ask, now that body shines
no longer, by what light you learn these lines
and what the b and d stood for.
Every year without knowing it I have passed the day 
When the last fires will wave to me 
And the silence will set out 
Tireless traveller 
Like the beam of a lightless star 
Then I will no longer 
Find myself in life as in a strange garment 
Surprised at the earth 
And the love of one woman 
And the shamelessness of men 
As today writing after three days of rain 
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease 
And bowing not knowing to what
When you go away the wind clicks around to the north 
The painters work all day but at sundown the paint falls 
Showing the black walls 
The clock goes back to striking the same hour 
That has no place in the years
And at night wrapped in the bed of ashes 
In one breath I wake 
It is the time when the beards of the dead get their growth 
I remember that I am falling 
That I am the reason 
And that my words are the garment of what I shall never be 
Like the tucked sleeve of a one-armed boy
Which reminds me of another knock-on-wood
memory. I was cycling with a male friend,
through a small midwestern town. We came to a 4-way
stop and stopped, chatting. As we started again,
a rusty old pick-up truck, ignoring the stop sign, 
hurricaned past scant inches from our front wheels.
My partner called, "Hey, that was a 4-way stop!"
The truck driver, stringy blond hair a long fringe
under his brand-name beer cap, looked back and yelled,
          "You fucking niggers!"
And sped off.
My friend and I looked at each other and shook our heads.
We remounted our bikes and headed out of town.
We were pedaling through a clear blue afternoon
between two fields of almost-ripened wheat
bordered by cornflowers and Queen Anne's lace
when we heard an unmuffled motor, a honk-honking.
We stopped, closed ranks, made fists.
It was the same truck. It pulled over.
A tall, very much in shape young white guy slid out:
greasy jeans, homemade finger tattoos, probably
a Marine Corps boot-camp footlockerful
of martial arts techniques.
"What did you say back there!" he shouted.
My friend said, "I said it was a 4-way stop.
You went through it."
"And what did I say?" the white guy asked.
"You said: 'You fucking niggers.'"
The afternoon froze.
"Well," said the white guy,
shoving his hands into his pockets
and pushing dirt around with the pointed toe of his boot,
"I just want to say I'm sorry."
He climbed back into his truck
and drove away.
Tip their mouths open to the sky.   
Turquoise, amber,
the deep green with fluted handle,   
pitcher the size of two thumbs,   
tiny lip and graceful waist.
Here we place the smallest flower   
which could have lived invisibly   
in loose soil beside the road,   
sprig of succulent rosemary,
bowing mint.
They grow deeper in the center of the table.
Here we entrust the small life,   
thread, fragment, breath.   
And it bends. It waits all day.
As the bread cools and the children   
open their gray copybooks   
to shape the letter that looks like   
a chimney rising out of a house.
And what do the headlines say?
Nothing of the smaller petal
perfectly arranged inside the larger petal
or the way tinted glass filters light.   
Men and boys, praying when they died,
fall out of their skins.
The whole alphabet of living,   
heads and tails of words,
sentences, the way they said,   
“Ya’Allah!” when astonished,   
or “ya’ani” for “I mean”—
a crushed glass under the feet
still shines.         
But the child of Hebron sleeps
with the thud of her brothers falling   
and the long sorrow of the color red.
Some nights
the rat with pointed teeth   
makes his long way back   
to the bowl of peaches.
He stands on the dining room table   
sinking his tooth
drinking the pulp
of each fruity turned-up face   
knowing you will read
this message and scream.   
It is his only text,
to take and take in darkness,   
to be gone before you awaken   
and your giant feet
start creaking the floor.
Where is the mother of the rat?   
The father, the shredded nest,   
which breath were we taking   
when the rat was born,
when he lifted his shivering snout   
to rafter and rivet and stone?   
I gave him the names of the devil,   
seared and screeching names,   
I would not enter those rooms   
without a stick to guide me,
I leaned on the light, shuddering,   
and the moist earth under the house,   
the trailing tails of clouds,
said he was in the closet,
the drawer of candles,
his nose was a wick.
How would we live together
with our sad shoes and hideouts,
our lock on the door
and his delicate fingered paws
that could clutch and grip,
his blank slate of fur
and the pillow where we press our faces?   
The bed that was a boat is sinking.   
And the shores of morning loom up   
lined with little shadows,
things we never wanted to be, or meet,   
and all the rats are waving hello.
Now when I walk around at lunchtime
I have only two charms in my pocket
an old Roman coin Mike Kanemitsu gave me
and a bolt-head that broke off a packing case
when I was in Madrid the others never
brought me too much luck though they did
help keep me in New York against coercion
but now I'm happy for a time and interested 
I walk through the luminous humidity
passing the House of Seagram with its wet
and its loungers and the construction to
the left that closed the sidewalk if
I ever get to be a construction worker
I'd like to have a silver hat please
and get to Moriarty's where I wait for
LeRoi and hear who wants to be a mover and
shaker the last five years my batting average
is .016 that's that, and LeRoi comes in
and tells me Miles Davis was clubbed 12
times last night outside BIRDLAND by a cop
a lady asks us for a nickel for a terrible
disease but we don't give her one we
don't like terrible diseases, then 
we go eat some fish and some ale it's
cool but crowded we don't like Lionel Trilling
we decide, we like Don Allen we don't like
Henry James so much we like Herman Melville
we don't want to be in the poets' walk in
San Francisco even we just want to be rich
and walk on girders in our silver hats
I wonder if one person out of the 8,000,000 is
thinking of me as I shake hands with LeRoi
and buy a strap for my wristwatch and go
back to work happy at the thought possibly so 
I am not a painter, I am a poet.
Why? I think I would rather be
a painter, but I am not. Well,
for instance, Mike Goldberg
is starting a painting. I drop in.
"Sit down and have a drink" he
says. I drink; we drink. I look
up. "You have SARDINES in it."
"Yes, it needed something there."
"Oh." I go and the days go by
and I drop in again. The painting
is going on, and I go, and the days
go by. I drop in. The painting is
finished. "Where's SARDINES?"
All that's left is just
letters, "It was too much," Mike says.
But me? One day I am thinking of
a color: orange. I write a line
about orange. Pretty soon it is a
whole page of words, not lines.
Then another page. There should be
so much more, not of orange, of
words, of how terrible orange is
and life. Days go by. It is even in
prose, I am a real poet. My poem
is finished and I haven't mentioned
orange yet. It's twelve poems, I call
it ORANGES. And one day in a gallery
I see Mike's painting, called SARDINES. 
When the Dean said we could not cross campus
until the students gave up the buildings,
we lay down, in the street,
we said the cops will enter this gate
over us. Lying back on the cobbles,
I saw the buildings of New York City
from dirt level, they soared up
and stopped, chopped off--above them, the sky,
the night air over the island.
The mounted police moved, near us,
while we sang, and then I began to count,
12, 13, 14, 15,
I counted again, 15, 16, one
month since the day on that deserted beach,
17, 18, my mouth fell open,
my hair on the street,
if my period did not come tonight
I was pregnant. I could see the sole of a cop's
shoe, the gelding's belly, its genitals--
if they took me to Women's Detention and did
the exam on me, the speculum,
the fingers--I gazed into the horse's tail
like a comet-train. All week, I had
thought about getting arrested, half-longed
to give myself away. On the tar--
one brain in my head, another,
in the making, near the base of my tail--
I looked at the steel arc of the horse's
shoe, the curve of its belly, the cop's
nightstick, the buildings streaming up
away from the earth. I knew I should get up
and leave, but I lay there looking at the space
above us, until it turned deep blue and then
ashy, colorless, Give me this one
night, I thought, and I'll give this child
the rest of my life, the horse's heads,
this time, drooping, dipping, until
they slept in a circle around my body and my daughter
The trees on the hospital lawn
are lush and thriving. They too
are getting the best of care,
like you, and the anonymous many,
in the clean rooms high above this city,
where day and night the doctors keep
arriving, where intricate machines
chart with cool devotion
the murmur of the blood,
the slow patching-up of bone,
the despair of the mind.
When I come to visit and we walk out
into the light of a summer day,
we sit under the trees —
buckeyes, a sycamore, and one
black walnut brooding
high over a hedge of lilacs
as old as the red-brick building
behind them, the original
hospital built before the Civil War.
We sit on the lawn together, holding hands
while you tell me: you are better.
How many young men, I wonder,
came here, wheeled on cots off the slow trains
from the red and hideous battlefields
to lie all summer in the small and stuffy chambers
while doctors did what they could, longing
for tools still unimagined, medicines still unfound,
wisdoms still unguessed at, and how many died
staring at the leaves of the trees, blind
to the terrible effort around them to keep them alive?
I look into your eyes
which are sometimes green and sometimes gray,
and sometimes full of humor, but often not,
and tell myself, you are better,
because my life without you would be
a place of parched and broken trees.
Later walking the corridors down to the street,
I turn and step inside an empty rom.
Yesterday someone was here with a gasping face.
Now the bed is made all new,
the machines have been rolled away. The silence
continues, deep and neutral,
as I stand there, loving you. 
Who made the world? 
Who made the swan, and the black bear? 
Who made the grasshopper? 
This grasshopper, I mean-- 
the one who has flung herself out of the grass, 
the one who is eating sugar out of my hand, 
who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down-- 
who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes. 
Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face. 
Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away. 
I don't know exactly what a prayer is. 
I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down 
into the grass, how to kneel in the grass, 
how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields, 
which is what I have been doing all day. 
Tell me, what else should I have done? 
Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon? 
Tell me, what is is you plan to do 
With your one wild and precious life? 
He painted the mountain over and over again 
from his place in the cave, agape 
at the light, its absence, the mantled 
skull with blue-tinted hollows, wren-
like bird plucking berries from the fire 
her hair alight and so on
lemon grass in cafe in clear glass.
